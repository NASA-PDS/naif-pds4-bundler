naif-pds4-bundle worklist by MCS/NAIF, updated 6 April, 2021
============================================================

v0.1.0 - Generation of kernel lists.

v0.2.0 - Generation of a PDS4 Bundle with examples.

v0.3.0 - Generation of InSight Bundle from existing archive.

v0.4.0 - BVS/NAIF feedback incorporation (1/2)

  -- The facuet item of the configuration file to be a parameter instead
  --  Format of the Plan file can be reviewed and made more convenient for
     users.
  -- Kernel List, meta-kernel grammar, meta-kernel template to be part
     of the configuration file.
  -- spiceds template to be versioned, after all it will change continuously.
  -- Step 3 - Bundle/dataset structure generation to include staging area
     reference to make it clear to users.

  -- PCK file needs to be loaded as well. Maybe after all it is just better
     to generate and load a meta-kernel.
  -- Label and product comparison log visualization to be an option. Default
     to be set to false.
  -- Incorporate a comparison of selected files as well (as with the previous
     point, for those subject to user errors from configuration etc.)
  --  URN or LID to be fully configurable (for example KPLO will need that).
  -- Automated documentation to be generated from function and class
     headers with Spynx. This will be useful for developers and for the
     community.
  -- Documentation of the process not to use faketex or any NAIF style instead
     use MD for example.
  -- dsindex files not required for PDS4 archives (update in generation
     index Perl script not really required).

v0.5.0

  -- Add test case for using similar labels from previous increment
     (that is case 2; not the appropriate one).
  -- Beware of meta-kernels with "_v" in name besides from version.
  -- Split meta-kernel by year.
  -- Convert configuration file to a format similar to NDT or an XML file
     that can be validated against a schematron. JSON can still be used as an
     intermediate format if need be.
  -- Files that need a change in the filename to be a configuration item
     (kernel list will then be generated easier).  
  -- Incorporate a validation at the end of the process that reports on
     sensible field such as descriptions, start and stop times, and other
     fields to be considered, this report could be presented as table.  
  -- For PDS3 first implement generation with MKLABL with the ultimate goal
     to replace it completely with Python code.
  -- Same approach for Perl scripts, end up replacing them with Python code.        
  -- Evaluate or assess file permissions, changing could be optional.Â®
