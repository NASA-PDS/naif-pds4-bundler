Overview

The NAIF PDS4 Bundler package (NPB) is an open source software project led
by the NAIF group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with the support of
the Planetary Data System Engineering Node (PDS-EN).

NPB is hosted at the `NASA PDS GitHub repository <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/naif-pds4-bundler>`_ and
is easy to install since it is hosted in the Python Package Index
and includes a number of ready-to-go examples that facilitate the task to set
it up.

The planetary data community and SPICE archive producers are encouraged to
contribute to the project following the `NASA PDS Code of Conduct <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.
The expected forum to have discussions related to NPB is the `OpenPlanetary community <http://openplanetary.co/>`_.

This document describes the process to prepare SPICE archives and describes
the NAIF approach to using PDS4 standards in great detail.
