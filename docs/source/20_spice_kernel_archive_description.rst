SPICE Kernel Archive Description
********************************

This section describes the structure and contents of a PDS SPICE
bundle following the PDS4 standard using the NAIF approach [PDS3GUIDE]_.

There might be some concepts and/or words used in this chapter that
you might not know or understand, if so please take a look at the documents
that describe the PDS4 standards. These documents are available at the
`PDS Data Standards Document page <https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/documents>`_.

Don't worry, everything that is specified in this chapter is implemented by the
NAIF PDS4 Bundler: the idea of this chapter is to provide you background and the
rationale of how and why SPICE kernel archives are implemented this way.
