SPICE Kernel Archive Description
********************************

Overview
========

This section describes the structure and contents of a PDS SPICE
bundle following the PDS4 standard and using the NAIF approach.

There might be some concepts and/or words used in this chapter that
you might not know or understand, if so please take a look at the documents
that describe the PDS4. They are available at the [PDS Data Standards
Document page](https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/documents ).

Don't worry, everything that is specified in this chapter is implemented by the
NAIF PDS Bundler; the idea of this chapter is to provide you background and the
rationale of how and why SPICE kernel archives are implemented this way.
