Software package by [NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/)
that enables SPICE kernels archive producers to get familiar with,
design, and generate [Planetary Data System](https://pds.nasa.gov/) SPICE
archives from end-to-end using the applicable PDS4 standards.
