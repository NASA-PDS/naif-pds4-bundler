Overview
========

   This archive includes the complete set of VCO SPICE data files
   (kernel files), which can be accessed using SPICE software. The
   SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information needed
   to recover the full value of science instrument data. In particular
   SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary ephemerides,
   spacecraft and instrument orientation, instrument mounting
   alignments, and data needed for relevant time conversions. Data in
   the SPICE kernel files must be accessed using the software called
   the SPICE Toolkit produced and distributed by the Navigation and
   Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data
   System.

   This archive includes data covering from VCO launch, 2010-05-20,
   through the end time of the latest spacecraft orientation file
   supplied in the archive. Until the end of the spacecraft lifespan
   this archive will be accumulating with new data added according to
   the project archiving plan.

   This archives supersedes the Venus Climate Orbiter PDS3 data set:

Errata
======

   1. This document is a simple HTML document. Providing documents in a
      simple mark-up format was allowed by earlier versions of the PDS4
      Standards but became prohibited in later versions starting summer
      2015. Since the document was compliant at the time when its first
      version was released, it will continue to exist in the archive
      as an HTML document.

   2. The kernels present in the first release of this bundle have embedded
      PDS3 labels. This is intentional in order to preserve the original
      kernels from the PDS3 data set that this PDS4 bundle supersedes.

<A NAME="Kernel Types"></A>
Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of
   this archive.

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this
   archive.

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory of this archive.

SPK Files

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets, and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures.

   This archive includes binary SPK files under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory (Only the leading portions of the file names are shown; the file
   name extensions of the binary SPK files are always ``.bsp''):

      vco_YYYY_vVV        SPK files containing the trajectory of the
                          Venus Climate Orbiter spacecraft relative
                          to the sun or Venus barycenter, mostly
                          created during operations by the ISAS orbit
                          determination group, JAXA. Most of source
                          data for 2010 and for some periods around
                          orbital maneuvers in 2015 were created by
                          the NASA JPL Navigation Team. YYYY in the
                          file name that represents the year identify
                          the period covered by the file.

      vco_de423_de430     vco_de423_de430 combined planetary ephemeris
                          SPK containing data from both de423 and
                          de430. This kernel contains the results of
                          merging portions of DE423 with DE430, to
                          produce a single SPK file that should be
                          valid for the bulk of the entire Venus
                          Climate Orbiter mission.

   If this data set contains multiple SPK files for a particular period,
   the one with the latest version (VV) supersedes all previous versions.

   The most detailed description of the data in each SPK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   This information can be viewed using the utility program COMMNT
   included in the NAIF Toolkit.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<a name="PCK Files"/>

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical, and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as
   size and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and
   prime meridian.

   The PCK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory (Only file names are shown; the file name extensions of the text
   PCK kernel files are always ``.tpc''):

      vco_gm_de431_vVV   PCK file containing mass parameters used in
                         the Venus Climate Orbiter mission. This file
                         is based on gm_de431.tpc, created by NAIF, and
                         then modified only GM values for Venus and
                         Venus barycenter, where VV is the version number.

      pck00010           generic PCK file containing IAU 2009 rotation
                         and shape constants for planets, satellites, and
                         some asteroids, created by NAIF.

   If this data set contains multiple PCK files, the one with the latest
   version (VV) supersedes all previous versions.

   In most cases these two PCK files

      pck00010.tpc
      vco_gm_de431_vVV.tpc

   should be loaded into a user's application to process data for
   the science phase(s) of the mission.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text PCK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

   If this data set contains multiple CK files for a particular period,
   the one with the latest version (VV) supersedes all previous versions.

   In most cases these CK files

      vco_YYYY_pred_vVV.bc
      vco_YYYY_vVV.bc
      vco_sap_nominal_vVV.bc
      vco_sap_YYYY_vVV.bc
      vco_xmga_YYYY_vVV.bc

   should be loaded in this order into a user's application to process
   data for the mission.

   The most detailed description of the data in each CK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   This information can be viewed using the utility program COMMNT
   included in the NAIF Toolkit.

<a name="LSK Files"/>
LSK Files

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB).

   This archive includes generic text LSK files produced by NAIF,
   containing leapsecond information based on the IERS announcements.

   The following LSK file is provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a>
   directory:

      naifVVVV.tls

   where VVVV is the file version. The latest LSK file supersedes all
   previous versions.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text LSK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<a name="SCLK Files"/>
SCLK Files

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
   time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK).

   The following Frames Kernel files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk">spice_kernels/sclk</a>
   directory (only the leading portion of the file name is shown; the extension
   of all file names is ``.tsc''):

      vco_vVV   SCLK file containing clock correlation data for the
                Venus Climate Orbiter spacecraft on-board clock,
                created by the PLANET-C Project Team, where VV is the
                version number.

   If this data set contains multiple SCLK files for a particular period,
   the one with the latest version (VV) supersedes all previous versions.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text SCLK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<a name="FK Files"/>
FK Files

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments.

   The following Frames Kernel files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory (only the name portion of the file name is shown on the right;
   the extension of all file names is ``.tf''):

      rssd0002             Generic Frames Definition Kernel for ESA
                           Planetary Missions. 0002 is the version number.
                           This file is used in the Venus Climate Orbiter
                           mission to calculate orbit number for the Venus
                           Climate Orbiter spacecraft.

      vco_spacecraft_vVV   FK file containing the definition of the Venus
                           Climate Orbiter spacecraft body-fixed frame
                           and frames for its engineering structures and
                           science instruments, created by the PLANET-C
                           Project Team, where VV is the version number.

   If this data set contains multiple FK files, the one with the latest
   version (VV) supersedes all previous versions.

   In most cases both FK files should be loaded into a user's
   application to process data for the science phase(s) of the mission.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text FK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<a name="MK Files" />
MK Files

   Meta-kernel (MK) files (a.k.a 'furnsh' files) provide lists of the
   archived kernels included in this archive suitable for loading into
   a SPICE-based application via the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. Using meta-kernels makes it easy to load with
   one call a comprehensive SPICE data collection.

   The text MK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory follow this pattern:

      vco_vVV.tm

   where ``VV'' is the file version.

   Multiple versions of a meta-kernel may exist if new kernels were
   added to the archive in a later release and the meta-kernel for
   that it had to be updated to incorporate them. The reasons for
   adding new kernels include (but are not limited to) adding new
   kinds of kernels, adding new versions of existing kernels
   containing more complete or more accurate data, and adding new
   versions of existing kernels superseding the existing kernels that
   had errors. If more than one meta-kernel file is present, then the
   file with the latest version number supersedes all earlier
   versions.
   (Note that on some environments loading too many kernels at once may
   slow down data access.)

   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the directory in which they reside -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to '..' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the archive's 'spice_kernels' directory on
   their system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in
   all path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.

   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these meta-kernels:

     -  the latest archived versions of LSK and FK were included

     -  the sets of the CKs, SPKs, PCKs, IKs, and SCLKs were picked
        according to the recommendations made in the corresponding
        sections of this document

     -  the predicted CKs where produced for Venus Climate Orbiter
        spacecraft attitude are also included in the metakernel, listed
        before each reconstructed CK kernel for the spacecraft attitude.
        This way, the reconstructed information will have preference,
        and the predicted attitude will be used only for periods of time
        when there is no reconstructed attitude

     -  the nominal CK where produced for solar array paddles
        of Venus Climate Orbiter spacecraft is also included in the
        metakernel, listed before each reconstructed CK kernel for the
        solar array paddles orientations. This way, the reconstructed
        information will have preference, and the nominal orientation
        will be used only for periods of time when there is no
        reconstructed orientation

   Additional description of the kernels sets listed in a text MK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="Miscellaneous Files"></A>
Miscellaneous Files
===================

   Miscellaneous files provide value added elements that are outside the
   scope of the PDS archive requirements. Miscellaneous files included in
   this archive are currently limited to checksum and orbit number files.

   The subsection below provides details for these files.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="Checksum Files"></A>
Checksum Files

   A checksum file provides a table of MD5 checksums for all files in the
   archive as of a particular archive (bundle) version, including
   checksums for all previous checksums files and their labels but
   excluding the checksum for the checksum file itself and its label.

   The checksum files are provided under the <a href="../miscellaneous/checksum/">miscellaneous/checksum</a>
   directory and are named:

      checksum_vVVV.tab

   where ``VVV'' is the file version.

   The file with the latest version supersedes all files with earlier versions
   and can be used to validate the archive in its entirety.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="Orbit Number Files"></A>
Orbit Number Files

   An orbit number (ORBNUM) file provides a table of records ordered
   by an increasing orbit numbering scheme. The orbit number changes
   at every periapsis event and the information contained for each
   record includes:

    - Orbit number ("No".)
    - Periapsis UTC time ("Event UTC PERI")
    - SCLK time ("Event SCLK PERI" )
    - Apoapsis UTC time ("OP-Event UTC APO")
    - Sub-solar geodetic longitude and latitude (SolLon, SolLat), in
      the IAU_VENUS reference frame.
    - Sub-spacecraft geodetic longitude and latitude (SC Lon, SC Lat),
      in the IAU_VENUS reference frame.
    - Altitude of the vehicle above the primary body (Alt)
    - Inclination of the vehicle orbit (Inc)
    - Eccentricity of the orbit plane about the primary body (Ecc)
    - Longitude of the ascending node of the orbit (LonNode)
    - Argument of periapsis of the orbit (Arg Per)
    - Solar distance the time of the orbit event (Sol Dist)
    - Semimajor axis of the orbit (Semi Axis)

   All the orbital elements are calculated in the VME2000 reference
   frame. See rssd0002.tf for details about this frame.

   The ORBNUM files have been generated during the mission using the
   NAIF's ORBNUM utility program for consolidated spacecraft trajectory
   SPK files for the orbital phases of the mission. Orbit number 1
   corresponds to the first orbit, started from 2015-12-07.

   The ORBNUM files are provided under the <a href="../miscellaneous/orbnum/">miscellaneous/orbnum</a>
   directory and are named:

      vco_vVV.orb

   where ``VV'' is the file version.

   The file with the latest version supersedes all files with earlier versions.

   The files included in this dataset are the most recent files
   available at the moment of the compilation of each release of this
   dataset, which should span at least the same time interval as all
   the SPK files included in the dataset.

<A NAME="File Formats"></A>
File Formats
============

   All text documents and other meta information files such as descriptions,
   detached PDS4 labels, and inventory tables, are stream format files, with
   a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed character (ASCII 10) at the
   end of the records. This allows the files to be read by most operating
   systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, FKs,
   and MKs --, the ORBNUM files, and the checksum files are UNIX text files,
   with a line feed character (ASCII 10) at the end of each line. Binary
   kernel files -- SPKs and CKs -- are IEEE LSB binary files. While data
   files in this archive can be used 'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the
   majority of supported environments, converting the files to the binary or
   text format native to the user's computer may be required for use of the
   data with FORTRAN toolkits on incompatible environments. Refer to the
   documentation provided with the SPICE Toolkit to find out whether
   conversion is needed in each specific case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
