<A NAME="Overview"></A>
Overview
========

   This archive includes the complete set of OSIRIS-REx SPICE data files
   (kernel files), which can be accessed using SPICE software. The
   SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information needed
   to recover the full value of science instrument data. In particular
   SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary ephemerides,
   spacecraft and instrument orientation, instrument mounting
   alignments, and data needed for relevant time conversions. Data in
   the SPICE kernel files must be accessed using the software called
   the SPICE Toolkit produced and distributed by the Navigation and
   Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data
   System.

   This archive includes data covering from OSIRIS-REx launch, 2016-09-08,
   through the end time of the latest spacecraft orientation file
   supplied in the archive. Until the end of the spacecraft lifespan
   this archive will be accumulating with new data added according to
   the project archiving plan.

<A NAME="Errata"></A>
Errata
======

   1. This document is a simple HTML document. Providing documents in a
      simple mark-up format was allowed by earlier versions of the PDS4
      Standards but became prohibited in later versions starting summer
      2015. Since the document was compliant at the time when its first
      version was released, it will continue to exist in the archive
      as an HTML document.

   2. All IK files (except the OCAMS IK orx_ocams_v07.ti) included in
      the archive are placeholder versions containing only Field-Of-View
      (FOV) definitions. More complete versions of these IKs will be
      added to the archive in subsequent releases.

   3. The original meta-kernel names embedded in the comments of the
      these "noola" meta-kernels

      orx_noola_2016_v01.tm orx_noola_2016_v02.tm orx_noola_2016_v03.tm
      orx_noola_2016_v04.tm orx_noola_2016_v05.tm orx_noola_2017_v01.tm
      orx_noola_2017_v02.tm orx_noola_2017_v03.tm orx_noola_2017_v04.tm
      orx_noola_2017_v05.tm orx_noola_2018_v01.tm orx_noola_2018_v02.tm
      orx_noola_2018_v03.tm orx_noola_2018_v04.tm orx_noola_2019_v01.tm
      orx_noola_2019_v02.tm

      are not correct. They are missing the "noola" token.

   4. The 31.7 meter resolution shown in the description attributes
      in the bennu_g_03170mm_spc_obj_0000n00000_v020.xml label and in
      the title line of the bennu_g_03170mm_spc_obj_0000n00000_v020.bds
      DSK internal comments is not correct. It should be 3.17 meters.

   5. The spacecraft trajectory from 2020-OCT-20 21:49:49.420 UTC to
      2020-NOV-10 00:00:00.000 UTC, which reconstructs the back away
      portion of the sample collection (TAG), has a discrepancy with the
      reconstructed trajectory that follows. This is due to the drift away
      and little knowledge of the s/c position relative to Bennu. Note that
      additional trajectory jumps might be present at other boundaries since
      KinetX did not constraint the start of a new operations solution to
      match exactly a previously delivered trajectory. In addition to this,
      several trajectory deliveries were associated with certain PCKs that
      were delivered at those times which would also exacerbate this issue.

   6. The XML labels of the reconstructed OLA mirror orientation CKs before
      release 12 contain a typo in their description: they specify that the
      original name of the file had "bc" extension whereas they had "ck"
      extension.

   7. The XML labels of the ancillary products have the reference_type
      attribute of the Internal_Reference association within the
      Reference_List class of the Context_Area class pointing to the latest
      archive description document set to "ancillary_to_data" which is not
      correct. The correct value "ancillary_to_document" could not be used
      in these labels because it is not available in the PDS4 information
      model (IM) 1.5.0.0 used by this archive. This value was added to IM
      only in the version 1.14.0.0.

   8. The Miscellaneous collection was only added to the bundle in the
      release 12 (August 2021) and therefore the, checksum tables, and
      collection inventories and their labels that correspond to previous
      releases were added irregularly in that release. This is reflected
      in the bundle label of that particular release that contains
      additional Bundle_Member_Entry classes for these miscellaneous
      collections.

<A NAME="Kernel Types"></A>
Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of
   this archive.

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this
   archive.

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files also frequently contain NAIF name/ID mappings
   for bodies, spacecraft instruments and structures, and for DSK
   surfaces. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   DSK (Digital Shape Kernel) files contain detailed shape models for
   extended objects such as planets, natural satellites, asteroids, and
   comet nuclei. DSK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/dsk/">spice_kernels/dsk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory of this archive.

<A NAME="SPK Files"></A>
SPK Files

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures.

   This archive includes binary SPK files containing the following
   kinds of ephemeris data:

      -  planetary ephemeris SPKs

            These SPKs contain ephemeris data for the Solar System
            planet barycenters, and Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and
            Moon. They are produced by the JPL Solar System Dynamics
            group and are named DEXXX, e.g. DE424.

      -  Asteroid Bennu ephemeris SPKs

            These SPKs contain ephemeris data for asteroid Bennu. They
            are produced by the OSIRIS-REx science team.

      -  reconstructed spacecraft trajectory SPKs.

            These SPKs contain the reconstructed OSIRIS-REx spacecraft
            trajectory determined by the OSIRIS-REx Flight Dynamics
            (FDS) team, KinetX.

      -  structures SPKs

            These SPKs contain fixed locations of selected spacecraft
            structures and science instruments. They are produced by
            NAIF based on OSIRIS-REx engineering documentation.

   The SPK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following schemas:

      -  planetary ephemeris SPKs

               deVVVs.bsp

            where

               VVV       is the ephemeris version

               s         (optional) indicates that the original file
                         coverage was shortened to reduce the file
                         size.

      -  Asteroid Bennu ephemeris SPKs

               bennu_*_vV.bsp

            where

               V         is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named files
                         with earlier versions.

      -  reconstructed spacecraft trajectory SPKs

               orx_YYMMDD_YYMMDD_yymmdd_odDDD_vV.bsp

            where

               YYMMDD    are the file coverage start and stop dates

               yymmdd    is the data-cutoff (DCO) date, which is the
                         stop date of the reconstructed part of the
                         file.

                         WARNING: the trajectory beyond this date is
                         predicted and may differ substantially from
                         from the actual flown trajectory.

               DDD       is the three digit ID of the orbit
                         determination (OD) solution.

               V         is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named files
                         with earlier versions.

      -  structures SPKs

               orx_struct_vVV.bsp

            where

               VV        is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named files
                         with earlier versions.

   The most detailed description of the data in each SPK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   This information can be viewed using the utility program COMMNT
   included in the NAIF Toolkit.

<A NAME="PCK Files"></A>
PCK Files

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical, and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as
   size and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and
   prime meridian.

   This archive includes generic text PCK files produced by NAIF,
   containing data from the reports of the IAU Working Group on
   Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements, and asteroid Bennu
   text PCK files produced by NAIF from input provided by the
   OSIRIS-REx science team.

   The PCK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory and are named according to the following schemas:

      -  generic text PCKs

               pckVVVVV.tpc

               VVVVV     is the version; the file with the largest
                         number is the latest, but the user of PCK data
                         must decide if the latest version, or an
                         earlier version, is appropriate for his/her
                         analysis task.

      -  asteroid Bennu text PCK files

               bennu_vVV.tpc

<A NAME="CK Files"></A>
CK Files

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, articulating spacecraft structures, and articulating
   science instruments.

   This archive includes binary CK files containing the following kinds
   of orientation data:

      -  reconstructed spacecraft orientation CKs

            These CKs created by NAIF contain the reconstructed
            OSIRIS-REx spacecraft attitude determined on-board and
            downlinked in spacecraft telemetry.

      -  reconstructed Solar Array (SA) orientation CKs

            These CKs created by NAIF contain the reconstructed
            OSIRIS-REx SA gimbal angles measured on-board and
            downlinked in spacecraft telemetry.

      -  reconstructed OLA mirror orientation CKs

            These CKs created by the OLA science team at Applied
            Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, contain the
            reconstructed OSIRIS-REx OLA mirror orientation computed
            from OLA mirror azimuth and elevation angles from the
            corresponding OLA Level 1 (L1) product records.

      -  reconstructed Touch-And-Go Sample Arm Mechanism (TAGSAM)
         orientation CKs

            These CKs created by NAIF contain the reconstructed
            OSIRIS-REx TAGSAM gimbal angles measured on-board and
            downlinked in spacecraft telemetry.

   The CK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory and are named according to the following schemes:

      -  spacecraft, solar array, and TAGSAM CKs

               orx_NAME_TYPE_YYMMDD_yymmdd_vVV.bc

            where

               NAME      is the structure acronym

                            sc     for spacecraft
                            sa     for SA
                            tag    for TAGSAM

               TYPE      is the data type

                            rel    for reconstructed, long
                            rec    for reconstructed

               YYMMDD    is the file coverage start date

               yymmdd    is the file coverage stop date

               VV        is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

      -  OLA CKs

               orx_ola_YYMMDD_scil2idxxxxx[_vVV].bc

            where

               YYMMDD    is the file coverage start date for the first
                         record in the associated OLA Level 2 (L2)
                         science product

               scil2     identifies the CK file as being associated
                         with an OLA L2 science data product

               idxxxxx   denotes the 5 digit unique id (xxxxx) for the
                         given YYMMDD. This handles the case where the
                         scan ID may be rolled over; the combination of
                         YYMMDD and xxxxx is enough to uniquely
                         identify a given CK or an OLA science product.

               VV        is the version, optional and omitted for
                         version 01 products; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named files
                         with earlier versions.

   The most detailed description of the data in each CK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   For the OLA CKs covering from March 2019 this description also
   provides a detailed algorithm of how OLA mirror orientation was
   computed from OLA mirror azimuth and elevation angles. This
   information can be viewed using the utility program COMMNT included
   in the NAIF Toolkit.

<A NAME="FK Files"></A>
FK Files

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files also frequently contain NAIF name/ID mappings
   for bodies, spacecraft instruments and structures, and for DSK
   surfaces.

   This archive includes text FK files defining reference frames for
   the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, its structures, and science instruments.
   These FKs were produced by NAIF using the spacecraft and instrument
   design documentation as well as actual instrument alignment values
   determined pre-launch and as the result of in-flight calibrations.

   It also includes text FK files defining surface name/ID mappings for
   the surfaces provided in Bennu DSK files. These FKs were produced by
   the OSIRIS-REx Altimetry Working Group (AltWG).

   The FK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

   extended objects such as planets, natural satellites, asteroids, and
   comet nuclei.

   This archive includes binary DSK files containing digital shape data
   for the OSIRIS-REx mission target asteroid Bennu. These DSKs were
   produced by the OSIRIS-REx science team.

<A NAME="MK Files"></A>
MK Files

   Meta-kernel (MK) files (a.k.a 'furnsh' files) provide lists of the
   archived kernels included in this archive suitable for loading into
   a SPICE-based application via the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. Using meta-kernels makes it easy to load, with one
   call, a comprehensive SPICE data collection for a given period.

   The text MK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  OSIRIS-REx yearly MK files

               orx_YYYY_vVV.tm

      -  OSIRIS-REx yearly MK files without OLA CKs

               orx_noola_YYYY_vVV.tm

            where

               YYYY      is the year covered by the kernels listed in
                         the MK

               VV        is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

   Multiple versions of a meta-kernel for the same year may exist if
   new kernels were added to the archive in a later release and the
   meta-kernel for that year had to be updated to incorporate them. The
   reasons for adding new kernels include (but are not limited to)
   adding new kinds of kernels, adding new versions of existing kernels
   containing more complete or more accurate data, and adding new
   versions of existing kernels superseding the existing kernels that
   had errors. If more than one meta-kernel file for the same year is
   present, then the file with the latest version number supersedes all
   earlier versions. The latest yearly meta-kernels can be loaded
   together sorted by year to provide coverage for more than one year.
   (Note that on some environments loading too many kernels at once may
   slow down data access.)

   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the directory in which they reside -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to '..' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the archive's 'spice_kernels' directory on
   their system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in
   all path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.

   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   the orx_YYYY_vVV.tm meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCKs, SCLK, IKs, FK, generic
         SPKs, and fixed offset SPKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed OSIRIS-REx FDS SPKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed spacecraft, solar array, and TAGSAM
         CKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed OLA CKs were included

      -  no DSKs were included

   The orx_noola_YYYY_vVV.tm MKs include exactly same set of kernels as
   the orx_YYYY_vVV.tm MKs while omitting OLA CKs that are very large
   in size, have many segments, and are not needed for applications
   that don't seek computing the actual OLA view geometry. It is
   recommended any such applications use this set of MKs and, if
   desired to reduce the total size of the archive, delete all
   OLA CKs (spice_kernels/ck/orx_ola_*.bc) from the archive.

   Additional description of the kernels sets listed in a text MK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="Miscellaneous Files"></A>
Miscellaneous Files
===================

   Miscellaneous files provide value added elements that are outside the
   scope of the PDS archive requirements. Miscellaneous files included in
   this archive are currently limited to checksum files.

   The subsection below provides details for these files.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="Checksum Files"></A>
Checksum Files

   A checksum file provides a table of MD5 checksums for all files in the
   archive as of a particular archive (bundle) version, including
   checksums for all previous checksums files and their labels but
   excluding the checksum for the checksum file itself and its label.

   The checksum files are provided under the <a href="../miscellaneous/checksum/">miscellaneous/checksum</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  OSIRIS-REx checksum files

               checksum_vVVV.tab

            where

               VVV       is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions and can be
                         used to validate the archive in its
                         entirety.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="File Formats"></A>
File Formats
============

   All text documents, checksum files, and other meta information files
   such as descriptions, detached PDS4 labels, and inventory tables, are
   stream format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed
   character (ASCII 10) at the end of the records. This allows the files
   to be read by most operating systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, FKs,
   and MKs -- are UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10)
   at the end of each line. Binary kernel files -- SPKs, CKs, and DSKs --
   are IEEE LSB binary files. While data files in this archive can be used
   'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the majority of supported environments,
   converting the files to the binary or text format native to the user's
   computer may be required for use of the data with FORTRAN toolkits on
   incompatible environments. Refer to the documentation provided with the
   SPICE Toolkit to find out whether conversion is needed in each specific
   case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
