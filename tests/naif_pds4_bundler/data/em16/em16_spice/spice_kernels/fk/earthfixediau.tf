This kernel associates the IAU_EARTH frame with the EARTH_FIXED
reference frame alias.  Loading this kernel together
with a kernel whose data are relative to the EARTH_FIXED frame
(for example, an SPK or topocentric frame kernel for tracking stations)
allows the SPICE system to treat that kernel's data as though
they were relative to the IAU_EARTH frame.  

This kernel normally should be loaded together with a text PCK file 
providing earth rotation data.

For high-accuracy work, the ITRF93 frame should be used
rather than the IAU_EARTH frame, and the kernel EARTHFIXEDITRF93.TF
should be used in place of this one to associate the alias
EARTH_FIXED with the ITRF93 frame.
