Implementation Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Applications that need SPICE I-kernel data must ``load'' the I-kernel file,
   normally during program initialization. The SPICE routine FURNSH loads a
   kernel file into the pool as shown below.

      CALL FURNSH ( 'frame_kernel_name' )    -- FORTRAN
      furnsh_c ( "frame_kernel_name" );      -- C
      cspice_furnsh, frame_kernel_name       -- IDL
      cspice_furnsh( 'frame_kernel_name' )   -- MATLAB

   Loading the kernel using the SPICELIB routine FURNSH causes the data
   items and their associated values present in the kernel to become
   associated with a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. 
   
   Once the file has been loaded, the SPICE routine GETFOV (getfov_c in
   C, cspice_getfov in IDL and MATLAB) can be used to retrieve FOV
   parameters for a given instrument or structure.
   
   The application program may obtain the value(s) for any other IK data
   item using the SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, GCPOOL (gdpool_c, gipool_c,
   gcpool_c in C, cspice_gdpool, cspice_gipool, cspice_gcpool in IDL and
   MATLAB). See [2] for details.

   This file was created with, and can be updated with a text editor or
   word processor.
   

Conventions for Specifying Data
--------------------------------------------------------

   Data items are specified using ``keyword=value'' assignments [2].
   All keywords referencing values in this I-kernel start with the
   characters `INS' followed by the NAIF TGO instrument ID code,
   constructed using the spacecraft ID number (-143) followed by the
   NAIF three digit ID number for NOMAD module. These IDs are
   defined in [4] as follows:
      
      Name                         NAIF ID
     ---------------------        ---------
      TGO_NOMAD_LNO                -143310
      TGO_NOMAD_LNO_OPS_NAD        -143311
      TGO_NOMAD_LNO_OPS_OCC        -143312
      TGO_NOMAD_SO                 -143320
      TGO_NOMAD_UVIS_NAD           -143331
      TGO_NOMAD_UVIS_OCC           -143332

     
   The remainder of the keyword name is an underscore character
   followed by the unique name of the data item. For example, the
   SO spectrometer boresight direction in the TGO_NOMAD_SO frame
   is specified by:

           INS-143320_BORESIGHT


   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.

   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same
   item appears more than once within a single file, the latest value
   supersedes any earlier values.

   
Instrument Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   NOMAD consists of three separate channels, solar occultation (SO), limb
   nadir and occultation (LNO), and ultraviolet and visible spectrometer
   (UVIS), all controlled via a single main electronics interface (see [5]).
   
   NOMAD has two nadir lines of sight (one in the LNO and one in the UVIS
   channel) that are parallel to the spacecraft -Y axis, which nominally
   is always pointing towards and perpendicular to the surface of Mars.
   Therefore, NOMAD's nadir viewports are always directed to Mars. The orbital
   configuration of TGO fixes the angle between its -Y axis and the direction
   of the Martian limb to 67.07 degrees away from the -Y axis in the -Y/-X
   plane. NOMAD's three solar lines of sight (one in each of the channels) will
   be parallel to this limb direction, and hence form an angle of 67.07 degrees
   with the nadir lines of sight. To perform SO measurements, the spacecraft
   will need to yaw rotate around its Y axis twice per orbit, once during the
   day, once during the night, so that, well before sunrise or sunset, the
   solar lines of sight point to the limb. During SOs the spacecraft will
   adopt an inertial pointing mode, fixed on the center of the Sun, resulting
   in an apparent ingress into or egress from the Martian disk.
   
   Solar Occultation Channel
   -------------------------
   The Solar Occultation (SO) Channel is based on the principle of combining an
   AOTF as an order sorter and an echelle grating spectrometer. The spectral
   observation band covers the 2.3 to 4.3 microns range, the instrument line
   profile (ILP) is 0.22 cm-1 full width at half-maximum (FWHM) or better over
   the whole spectral range, to be sampled by at least two detector pixels.
   The instrument is optimized close to 3000 cm-1, resulting in an ILP of
   0.15 cm-1 FWHM at 3.3 microns.
   
   The FOV of the SO channel is driven by the fact that it has to observe
   solely during SO. This FOV has a spatial dimension of 30 arcmin. It is
   required that all the detector lines illuminated by the solar disk can
   be downloaded to Earth. Perpendicular to the spatial direction a FOV
   of 2 arcmin is maintained resulting in sufficient height resolution
   while vertically scanning through the Martian atmosphere (vertical
   sampling less than 1 km). From dimensional constraints it follows that
   the entrance aperture diameter of the SO channel shall be at maximum
   20 mm.
   
   SO has a SNR greater than 900 over the complete spectral range, measured
   over a zone of 200 detector columns centered on the column with the
   maximum signal, for a minimum solar signal (i.e., at maximum Mars-Sun
   distance) and including all instrument sources of noise. Table #1
   gives an overview of the characteristics of the SO channel.

         -----------------------------------------------------
   
   
   Limb, Nadir and Occultation Channel
   ------------------------------------
   The Limb, Nadir and Occultation (LNO) Channel has a SNR of greater than
   400 over the complete spectral domain, after binning of all detector rows
   by column, measured over a zone of 200 columns centered on the column with
   the maximum signal, for a minimum solar signal (i.e., at maximum Mars-Sun
   distance), and including all instrument sources of noise. In the region
   that contains the methane absorption line, LNO has an SNR of greater than
   1000.
   
   As a price to pay for the challenging SNR specification, the wavelength
   range (between 2.3 and 3.8 microns) and ILP (0.5 cm-1, sampled by at
   least two pixels) are reduced in comparison with SO.
   
   While defining an appropriate instantaneous FOV for the LNO channel, a
   compromise had to be found between the channel performance in SO (vertical
   sampling) and in nadir mode (SNR, footprint). LNO has a FOV of 150 x 4 arc
   minutes. Since LNO uses this FOV also for solar occultions, the vertical
   sampling capacity of LNO is reduced by a factor of 2 compared to the SO
   channel. The entrance aperture diameter of the LNO channel is nearly 30 mm,
   which is greater than that of the SO channel, to provide higher signal
   input. Table #1 gives an overview of the characteristics of the LNO channel.


   Ultraviolet and Visible Channel
   -------------------------------
   The Ultraviolet and Visible (UVIS) Channel UVIS operates in the wavelength
   domain between 200 and 650 nm. The spectrometer has two telescopes, one for
   each viewing channel. The spectrometer is based on the conventional
   Czerny-Turner configuration. The main components are the entrance slit, the
   aperture, the collimating mirror, the diffraction grating, the focusing
   mirror, the 2nd order filter and the detector CCD. The light is delivered
   by an optical fibre. The spectrometer configuration combines simplicity
   and high-performances. In particular, the spectral range is very broad
   (200-650nm) with optimized performance in the UV range. Blaze angle and
   incidence angle achieve the highest reflectance of the first diffraction
   order at 220nm. The 2nd order filter solves the issue of the overlap
   between the 1st diffraction order and the 2nd diffraction order of the
   grating. Indeed, due to the wide spectral range of the observed signal,
   first diffraction order rays and second diffraction order rays overlap
   on the detector. Hence a long-pass filter has been placed in front of the
   detector to block the second order contribution. The cutoff is chosen at
   340nm. The filter is a window partially coated. The 2nd order signal goes
   through a coated area. As such the 2nd order signal is completed blocked
   as long as the signal at wavelength shorter than the wavelength
   corresponding to the uncoated-coated transition of the filter. The slit
   width is 65 microns which corresponds to a resolution better than 1.5nm.
   This width results from a trade-off between resolution and the SNR. Table
   #2 summarizes the characteristics of the UVIS channel.

         -------------------------------------------------------------------

   
   Each telescope includes a single parabolic mirror for space and weight
   minimization. Light is focused on a single fibre and a bundle of fibres
   for the solar occultation channel and the nadir channel respectively. The
   field of views (2 arcmin for solar occultation and 43 arcmin for nadir) are
   determined by the focal length of the mirror and the entrance aperture of
   the fibre(s).

   UVIS has one periscope in front of the solar telescope with a mirror
   allowing the pointing towards the Sun and a cut out hole in the NOMAD
   cover for the nadir viewing telescope. UVIS switches between nadir and
   solar viewing angles by alternating which optic fibre cable is placed
   at the input of the spectrometer. The selector mechanism is a rotating
   motor mechanism that moves the fibres in front of the slit. Fibre
   positioning is accurately defined by two hard stops.

FOV Definition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section contains assignments defining the NOMAD LNO, SO and UVIS
   FOVs. These definitions are based on the NOMAD spectrometers parameters
   provided in the previous sections and are provided in a format
   consistent with/required by the SPICE TOOLKIT function GETFOV.
   
   
   NOMAD Limb, Nadir and Occultation Channel (TGO_NOMAD_LNO*) FoVs:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   The LNO FOV is defined as a rectangular pyramid with a full angle of
   150x4 arc-minutes. It is defined with respect to the TGO_NOMAD_LNO_OPS_NAD
   and TGO_NOMAD_LNO_OPS_OCC frames for nadir and solar occultation observations
   (see [5]). In addition a third FoV definition is provided for using the
   LNO Field-of-View together with the TGO_NOMAD_LNO CK-based instrument
   frame. The boresight and the cross-reference vectors are unit along the 
   +Z axis and the +X axis of the frame(s), respectively.
   
   Please note that the FOV reference and cross angles are defined with half 
   angle values.

   The SO FOV is defined as a rectangular pyramid with a full angle of
   30x2 arc-minutes. It is defined with respect to the TGO_NOMAD_SO
   frame (see [5]). The boresight and the cross-reference vectors are
   unit along the +Z axis and the +X axis of the frame, respectively.
   
   Please note that the FOV reference and cross angles are defined with
