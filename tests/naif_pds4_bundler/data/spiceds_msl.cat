      Data Set Overview
      =================

      This data set includes the complete set of MSL SPICE data files
      (``kernel files''), which can be accessed using SPICE software.
      The SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information
      needed to recover the full value of science instrument data. In
      particular SPICE kernels provide rover and planetary ephemerides,
      instrument mounting alignments, rover orientation, and data
      needed for relevant time conversions.

      This data set is contained on a single virtual volume,
      MSLSP_1000, including data from all mission phases and covering
      2011-11-26T15:51:07 through the end time of the latest rover
      surface path SPK file supplied in the data set. Until the end of
      the rover lifespan this data set will be accumulating with new
      data added approximately every three to six months.


      Data Types (SPICE kernel types)
      ===============================
   
      SPK kernels contain ephemerides for spacecraft, planets,
      satellites, comets and asteroids as well as for moving or fixed
      spacecraft and instrument structures. They provide position and
      velocity, given in a Cartesian reference frame. SPK files are
      located under the ``data/spk'' directory of this data set.
      
      PCK kernels contain certain physical, dynamical and cartographic
      constants for target bodies, such as size and shape
      specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
      meridian. PCK files are located under the ``data/pck'' directory
      of this data set.

      IK kernels (Instrument description kernels) give descriptive and
      operational data peculiar to a particular scientific instrument,
      such as internal timing relative to the spacecraft clock and
      field-of-view model parameters. IK files are located under the
      ``data/ik'' directory of this data set.

      CK kernels describe pointing, containing a transformation
      traditionally called the C-matrix which is used to determine
      time-tagged pointing (orientation) angles for a spacecraft
      structure upon which science instruments are mounted. CK files
      are located under the ``data/ck'' directory of this data set.

      EK (Events) kernels are derived from the integrated sequence of
      events used to produce actual spacecraft commands. EK files are
      located under the ``data/ek'' directory of this data set.

      LSK (Leapseconds) kernels contain the leapseconds and the values
      of other constants required to perform a transformation between
      Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET). LSK
      files are located under the ``data/lsk'' directory of this data
      set.

      SCLK (Spacecraft Clock) kernels contain on-board clock
      calibration data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
      time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files are
      located under the ``data/sclk'' directory of this data set.

      FK (Frame Definitions) kernels contain information required to
      define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
      connections between these frames and other frames supported
      within the SPICE system. This includes mounting alignment
      information for each instrument. FK files are located under the
      ``data/fk'' directory of this data set.
      

      Kernel File Details
      ===================
      
      A brief overview of the different types of MSL kernels included
      in this data set is provided in the CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE section
      of this file while details specific to individual files are found
      in the ``*info.txt'' files in the corresponding data directory.
      The most detailed description of the data in each file is
      provided in metadata included inside the file -- in the
      description area of text kernels or in the comment area of binary
      kernels.

   
      Software
      ========
   
      The SPICE Toolkit contains software modules needed to read SPICE
      kernel files. SPICE software is highly documented via internal
      headers. Additional documentation is available in separate ASCII
      text files called Required Reading files. For example, the S- and
      P- Kernel (SPK) Required Reading File, named SPK.REQ, describes
      use of the SPK kernel file readers and contains sample programs.
 
      The latest SPICE Toolkit for a variety of computer platforms such
      as PC, Mac, SUN, etc. is available at the NAIF Node of PDS
      electronically (via anonymous FTP and WWW servers). Refer to
      information in ``software/softinfo.txt'' for details regarding
      obtaining this software. Each version of the Toolkit is also
      archived at the NASA National Space Science Data Center.


      Loading Kernel Files into a SPICE-based Application
      ===================================================
 
      The easiest way to make data from a collection of SPICE kernels
      available to a SPICE-based application is to list these kernels
      in a meta-kernel and load it into the program using the high
      level SPICE data loader routine FURNSH. This data set provides
      such meta-kernel(s) under the ``extras/mk'' directory. For more
      information about the MSL meta-kernel(s), see the file
      ``extras/mk/mkinfo.txt''.

      "
      
    CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE            = "

      This data set contains SPICE kernel files created during mission
      operations and after mission data reconstruction and analysis.
      Some general information about this collection follows here, but
      the prospective user is also referred to extensive descriptions
      about each file that are stored inside each kernel file. These
      metadata provide detailed information regarding the information
      source from which the data were derived, the type of processing
      applied to the source data, applicability of the data, etc.
      Metadata are located in the ``comment area'' for binary kernel
      types (SPK, CK, ESQ), accessible using either the COMMNT or
      SPACIT utility program found in the NAIF Toolkit. Metadata are
      located after ``\begintext'' markers within the text kernel types
      (PCK, IK, FK, LSK, SCLK, MK), accessible by using any available
      text file display tool such as a word processor, text editor, or
      the unix ``more'' or ``cat'' commands.
 
      Where there are questions about data accuracy or ``confidence''
      not addressed herein the reader is invited to contact the NAIF
      node of the Planetary Data System for possible further
      information.
      
      SPK Files
      =========

      Six kinds of SPK files are provided in this archive: 

        -- cruise trajectory SPK
 
        -- EDL trajectory SPK
  
        -- landing site location SPK
 
        -- localized rover path and site locations SPKs

        -- telemetry-based rover path and site locations SPKs

        -- Solar System planets and satellites ephemeris SPKs

        -- rover structures and instruments locations SPK

      Each kind of file is briefly described below; more information is
      available in the file ``data/spk/spkinfo.txt''.

      Cruise trajectory SPK
      ---------------------
        The cruise trajectory SPK file contains the reconstructed
        cruise trajectory determined by the MSL Navigation (NAV) Team,
        JPL. The informal 1-sigma uncertainty for the MSL cruise
        trajectory reconstruction is TBD.

      EDL trajectory SPK
      ------------------
        The EDL trajectory SPK file contains the reconstructed EDL
        trajectory determined by the MSL EDL Team, JPL. The informal
        1-sigma uncertainty for the MSL EDL trajectory reconstruction
        is TBD.

      Landing site location SPK
      -------------------------
        The landing site location SPK file contains the landing site
        location relative to the center of Mars in the Mars body-fixed
        frame (IAU_MARS, based on IAU 2000 Mars rotation constants),
        determined by the MSL Localization Group, JPL. The informal
        accuracy estimate for the landing site location is TBD.
 
      Localized Rover path and site locations SPKs
      --------------------------------------------
        The localized rover path and site location SPK files contain the
        locations of the sites along the path relative to the center
        Mars and the location of the rover relative to the center of
        Mars. 

        These SPKs were created using localized data available in the
        PLACES server developed and maintained by the MSL Operations
        Product Generation Subsystem (OPGS) Team. The set of localized
        data in the PLACES server included rover and site location data
        for a limited set of localization points determined by tracing
        the rover traverse on high resolution maps, combined a subset
        of telemetry products to create a more complete set of location
        points. Because the telemetry products used in this process
        included only image headers and mobility summaries, containing
        rover location during non-motion periods, and did not include
        data from the high-rate mobility history products containing
        rover location during motion periods, these SPKs do not provide
        real data during motion but instead provide interpolated
        values.

        In global context the data provided in these SPKs is
        significantly more accurate than telemetered rover position
        estimated on-board. Because of this these SPKs should be
        preferred to the telemetry-based rover path SPKs.

      Telemetry-Based Rover path and site locations SPKs
      --------------------------------------------------
        The telemetry-based rover path and site location SPK files
        contain the locations of the sites along the path relative to
        the landing site and location of the rover relative to these
        sites.

        These SPKs were created using telemetry data available in the
        PLACES server developed and maintained by the MSL Operations
        Product Generation Subsystem (OPGS) Team. The set of telemetry
        data in the PLACES server included rover and site location data
        from only a subset of telemetry products containing such
        information. Specifically, it included data from the product
        and image headers and mobility summaries, containing rover
        location during non-motion periods, and did not include data
        from the high-rate mobility history products containing rover
        location during motion periods. For this reason, these SPKs do
        not provide real data during motion but instead provide
        interpolated values.

        Because data provided in these SPKs is based on telemetered
        rover position estimated on-board, these SPKs are only as
        accurate as that estimate, which, depending on the traverse
        distances, slippage and sliding, can off by meters.

      Solar System planets and satellites ephemeris SPKs
      --------------------------------------------------
        The DE425 planetary ephemeris and MAR085 Martian satellite
        ephemeris SPK files included in this data set contain
        ephemeris data for the Solar System planet barycenters, Sun,
        Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, and Martian moons. These
        versions of ephemerides were officially used by the project
        during mission operations. The internal comments included within 
        these SPK files provide detailed accuracy information.

      Rover structures and instruments locations SPK
      ----------------------------------------------
        The MSL structures SPK file included in this archive provides
        relative locations of selected rover structures and instruments
        such as Remote Sensing Mast (RSM), Robotic Arm (RA), and
        cameras. The data included in the file are based of dimensions
        from the spacecraft engineering drawings and CAHVORE camera
        model files.

      
      CK Files
      ========
      
      Four kinds of C-kernel files are provided in this archive:

        -- cruise orientation CKs

        -- EDL orientation CK

        -- rover orientation CKs
 
        -- RSM, RA, and HGA orientation CKs

      Each kind of file is briefly described below; more information is
      available in the file ``data/ck/ckinfo.txt''.

      Cruise orientation CKs
      ----------------------
        The cruise orientation CK files contain the reconstructed
        cruise orientation determined by the MSL ACS Team and the MSL
        NAV Team, JPL.

        The set of CKs provided by the MSL ACS Team includes a CK with
        complete cruise orientation based on H-vector direction without
        modeling spin, a CK with fully reconstructed orientation based
        on real-time quaternions covering only communication periods, a
        CK with high-rate high-accuracy orientation covering only a few
        very short periods during attitude maneuvers, and a CK with
        modeled orientation covering only non-communication periods.

        The CK provided by the MSL NAV team contains fully reconstructed
        orientation based on H-vector direction and NAV de-spinned
        tracking data, covering only communication periods.

      EDL orientation CK
      ------------------
        The EDL orientation CK file contains the reconstructed EDL
        orientation determined by the MSL EDL Team, JPL. The informal
        accuracy for the MSL EDL orientation reconstruction is TBD.

      Rover orientation CKs
      ---------------------
        The rover orientation CK files contain the orientation of the
        rover relative to the local level frame. 

        These CKs were created using telemetry data available in the
        PLACES server developed and maintained by the MSL OPGS Team.
        The set of telemetry data in the PLACES server included rover
        orientation data only from a subset of telemetry products
        containing such information. Specifically, it included data
        from the product and image headers and mobility summaries,
        containing rover orientation during non-motion periods, and did
        not include data from the high-rate mobility history products,
        containing rover orientation during motion periods. For this
        reason, these CKs do not provide real data during motion but
        instead provide interpolated values.
 
        Due to incomplete source data these CKs have gaps in coverage,
        which can be closed, if needed, using the CKSPANIT utility
        program.

      RSM, RA, and HGA orientation CKs
      --------------------------------
        The rover structure orientation CK files contain the
        orientation of the RSM, RA, and High Gain Antenna (HGA)
        relative to the rover frame.
  
        These CKs were created using telemetry data available in the
        PLACES server developed and maintained by the MSL OPGS Team.
        The set of telemetry data in the PLACES server included
        structure articulation angle data from only a subset of
        telemetry products containing such information. Specifically,
        it included data from the product and image headers and
        articulation summaries, containing structure articulation
        angles during non-articulation periods, and did not include
        data from the high-rate articulation history products,
        containing structure articulation angles during articulation
        periods. For this reason, these CKs do not provide real data
        during articulation but instead provide interpolated values.

        The sets of CKs for RSM and RA include CKs based on encoder
        angles (less accurate but more complete) and CKs based on
        resolver angles (more accurate but less complete).

        While RSM and HGA CKs based on resolver angles provide accurate
        orientation matching that computed in the flight software, the
        RA CKs do not because the simple forward kinematics approach
        implemented using these CKs and corresponding frame chains does
        not model flexing of the RA which can lead to end point
        orientation errors of a degree or more for some RA
        configurations.

        Due to incomplete source data these CKs have gaps in coverage,
        which can be closed, if needed, using the CKSPANIT utility
        program.


      PCK Files
      =========
      
      PCK files provide size, shape and orientation data for ``target''
      bodies such as Mars. A description of these data items and
      reference to their source is provided inside the PCK file, which
      is a simple text file that can be viewed using any word
      processor, text editor or text display utility.
  
      This data set includes the generic PCK file based on the
      IAU/IAG/COSPAR values published in 2000. 

      More information about the PCK files included in this data set is
      available in the file ``data/pck/pckinfo.txt''.


      FK Files
      ========
      
      Frames kernel files provide specifications for how one reference
      frame is defined relative to another frame. A description of
      these specifications and references to their source is provided
      inside the FK file, which is a simple text file that can be
      viewed using any word processor, text editor or text display
      utility.

      The MSL FK provided in this data set contains the complete set of
      frame definitions for the rover, its structures such as mast,
      arm, and antennas, and all of its science instruments. Meta
      information provided in the comments included in this file
      consists of the frame definitions, description of the frame
      relationships, source of and accuracy of the mounting alignment
      information, etc.
 
      More information about the MSL FK files is available in the file
      ``data/fk/fkinfo.txt''.


      IK Files
      ========
      
      Instrument kernel files provide specifications for geometric
      parameters and--where applicable--field-of-view size, shape and
      orientation for the named instruments. Metadata describing these
      estimates are provided in each IK file included in this archive.
      Parameter values were determined from pre-launch measurements,
      instrument parameters specification documents, and in some cases
      from analysis of in-flight calibration data. The accuracy
      estimates for these data vary from instrument to instrument and,
      where available, are included in the IK internal comments.
 
      This data set includes IK files for all rover cameras, a few
      other rover-mounted instruments, and all cruise stage, descent
      stage and rover mounted antennas.
 
      Because the sets of geometric parameters included in the IKs vary
      from instrument to instrument users are encouraged to carefully
      examine the IKs before using them.
 
      More information about MSL IK files is available in the file
      ``data/ik/ikinfo.txt''.

            
      SCLK Files
      ==========
      
      Spacecraft Clock kernel files provide a tabulation of data needed
      for converting time measurements between ephemeris time (ET) and
      spacecraft clock time (SCLK). For surface missions like MSL SCLK
      kernel files are also used to provide data for conversions between
      ET and Local Mean Solar Time (LMST).
 
      The ``data/sclk/sclkinfo.txt'' file provides names of and/or
      explains naming convention for each of the SCLK types provided in
      this data set.

      On-board Clock Correlation SCLKs
      --------------------------------
        These SCLK files provide a tabulation of data needed for
        converting time measurements between ephemeris time (ET) and
        MSL spacecraft clock time (SCLK). They are made from similar
        files -- SCLK/SCET file, or SCLKvSCET file -- produced by
        another mission entity.
 
        The official on-board correlation SCLK files used in operations
        and included in this data set provide correlation that is
        incorrect in an absolute sense by as much as 3 minutes during
        some periods (e.g. in the middle of cruise). The error stems
        from a combination of reasons: the spacecraft generated too
        few time correlation packets, the specifics of the process used
        to derive the correlation function, the requirements for
        backward compatibility between correlation versions imposed by
        the ground system tools, and the requirement to minimize the
        deployment of the new correlation in the ground data system.

        An improved SCLK file for the on-board clock correlation
        included in this data was made to specifically fix correlation
        during cruise where large time correlation errors translated to
        large attitude knowledge errors due to the spacecraft spin.
        This SCLK kernel is accurate to a 10-30 milliseconds before
        February 2012, to better than 5 milliseconds from February
        through July 2012, and to about a millisecond for August 2012.

        SPICE software does not prohibit an SCLK file from being used
        for time conversions occurring for ``future times'' (or more
        accurately, for epochs that occur later than the epoch of the
        last telemetry data used in producing the last correlation
        coefficients found in the SCLK file). Such ``predict'' time
        conversions are likely to be inaccurate (changed somewhat) once
        the epoch of interest has been passed.

      Local Mean Solar Time (LMST) SCLK files
      ---------------------------------------
        These SCLK files provide a way of converting between the Local
        Mean Solar Time (LMST) time system used during surface
        operations and other time systems. LMST was introduced as a
        replacement of the Local True Solar Time (LTST) because a time
        system with a constant duration of a second was needed for use
        in the planning and sequencing processes. The LMST is
        essentially a linear approximation of the local true solar time
        with the rate set equal to the mean Mars local second duration
        and the initial reference point set to LMST midnight of the
        landing SOL. Due to ellipticity of Mars orbit this
        approximation is periodic and deviates from the LTST by as much
        as 50 minutes during  Martian year. The difference between LTST
        and LMST is illustrated by this table:

      LSK Files
      =========
      
      Leapseconds kernel files provide a tabulation of ``leapseconds''
      and some other terms used in converting time measurements between
      ephemeris time (ET) and Universal Time (UTC). ``Spacecraft Event
      Time'' (SCET) is the commonly used name for UTC events measured
      at the spacecraft.
 
      Metadata describing how the LSK data are obtained or computed is
      contained inside the LSK text file. The time conversion provided
      by SPICE LSK files is accurate to approximately 0.000030 seconds.
 
      More information about the LSK files is available in the file
      ``data/lsk/lskinfo.txt''.


      EK Files
      ========
      
      The MSL project did not produce any EK files; therefore, no EKs
      are included in this data set.
