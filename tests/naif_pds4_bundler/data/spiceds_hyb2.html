Overview
========

   This archive includes a part of Hayabusa2 SPICE data files
   (kernel files), which can be accessed using SPICE software. The
   SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information needed
   to recover the full value of science instrument data. In particular
   SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary ephemerides,
   spacecraft and instrument orientation, instrument mounting
   alighments, and data needed for relevant time conversions. Data in
   the SPICE kernel files must be accessed using the software called
   the SPICE Toolkit produced and distributed by the Navigation and
   Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data
   System.

<a name="Kernel Types" />
Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD, and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leap seconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of
   this archive.

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this
   archive.

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high-level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory of this archive.

                         number is the latest, but the user of PCK
                         data must decide if the latest version,
                         or an earlier version, is appropriate
                         for his/her analysis task.

                         version, is appropriate for his/her analysis
                         task.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text IK file is

<a name="MK Files" />
MK Files

   Meta-kernel (MK) files (a.k.a 'furnsh' files) provide lists of the
   archived kernels included in this archive suitable for loading into
   a SPICE-based application via the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. Using meta-kernels makes it easy to load with
   one call a comprehensive SPICE data collection.

   The text MK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  Hayabusa2 MK files

               hyb2_vVV.tm

            when

               VV        is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

   Multiple versions of a meta-kernel may exist if new kernels were
   added to the archive in a later release and the meta-kernel for
   that it had to be updated to incorporate them. The reasons for
   adding new kernels include (but are not limited to) adding new
   kinds of kernels, adding new versions of existing kernels
   containing more complete or more accurate data, and adding new
   versions of existing kernels superseding the existing kernels that
   had errors. If more than one meta-kernel file is present, then the
   file with the latest version number supersedes all earlier
   versions.
   (Note that on some environments loading too many kernels at once may
   slow down data access.)

   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the directory in which they reside -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to '..' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the archive's 'spice_kernels' directory on
   their system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in
   all path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.

   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCK, SCLK, IK, FK, generic
         SPKs, fixed offset SPKs, and fixed orientation CKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed Hayabusa2 NAV SPKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed CKs were included

   Additional description of the kernels sets listed in a text MK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

File Formats
============


   All text documents and other meta information files such as
   descriptions, detached PDS4 labels, and inventory tables are stream
   format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed
   character (ASCII 10) at the end of the records.  This allows the
   files to be read by most operating systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, and
   FKs -- are UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10) at
   the end of the line, and binary kernels files -- SPKs and CKs -- are
   IEEE LSB binary files. While data files in this archive can be used
   'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the majority of supported
   environments, converting the files to the binary or text format
   native to the user's computer may be required for use of the data
   with FORTRAN toolkits on incompatible environments. Refer to the
   documentation provided with the SPICE Toolkit to find out whether
   conversion is needed in each specific case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
