Fake SCLK Kernel for MarCO-A (ID -65)
--------------------------------------------------------

   This SCLK kernel contains the data necessary for converting from
   ephemeris time (ET) to ticks for a fake clock associated with the
   MarCO-A spacecraft with ID code ID -65. This fake clock runs at the
   same rate as ET, starting at ET 2000-JAN-01-12:00:00.000 and going
   for 100 years. It has two fields -- seconds and milliseconds. The
   clock's granularity is 1 millisecond.

   WARNING:

      This SCLK kernel is intended to be used only to read MarCO-A
      CK files that were made with it. It is *NOT* compatible with
      and must *NOT* be used to convert the actual MarCO-A SCLK times
      from telemetry.
