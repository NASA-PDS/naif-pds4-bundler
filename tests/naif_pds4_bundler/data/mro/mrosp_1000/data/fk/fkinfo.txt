General Information About SPICE Frames Kernels
==============================================

   In the SPICE system, FRAMES kernel contains a set of information
   required to define various frames used in a particular mission,
   sources of orientation and origin location information for these
   frames and inter-connections between these frames and other frames
   supported within the SPICE system.

   The frame definitions information contained in the file can be
   utilized in conjunction with other data using the SPICE Toolkit
   APIs, calls to which can be integrated into user application
   programs. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system
   toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is located
   in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data
   set.

   Refer to the ``frames.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about definition and usage of the frames within the
   SPICE system.


MRO Frames Kernels Contained in This Data Set
=============================================

   The following Frames Kernel files are included in this data set (only
   name portion of the file name is shown; the extension of all FK file
   names is ``.tf''):

      mro_vVV     main MRO Frames kernel providing the complete set of
                  frame definitions for the MRO spacecraft, its
                  structures, and science instruments.

   If multiple MRO FK files of the same kind are present, the one with
   the latest version (VV) supersedes all previous versions.

   For HIRISE a particular IK version must be used with a particular FK
   version to ensure consistency between the optical distortion data
   provided in the IK and camera frame alignment data provided in the
   FK. The IKs version 1.0 or earlier must be used with the MRO FK
   version 1.3 or earlier while the IKs version 1.1 or later must be
   used with the MRO FK version 1.4 or later.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in an FK file is provided
   in metadata included inside the description area of the file. This
   information can be viewed using any text editor program.
