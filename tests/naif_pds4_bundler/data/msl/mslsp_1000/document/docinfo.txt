Generic and MSL Specific SPICE Documentation
============================================

   The complete set of generic SPICE documentation describing SPICE
   Kernel file formats and the ways data in the kernels can be accessed
   using the SPICE System Toolkit is distributed with the toolkit. Refer to
   the ``softinfo.txt'' document in the ``/software'' directory of this
   volume for more information regarding obtaining the SPICE Toolkit.

   The MSL data specific documentation is included within actual
   data files -- in the description area of the SPICE text kernel files
   (LSK, SCLK, text PCK, FK) or in the comments area of the SPICE binary
   kernel files (SPK, CK, binary PCK, EK) -- and can be viewed using
   any text editor (for text files) or COMMNT/SPACIT utility programs
   distributed with SPICE System toolkit (for binary files.)

   The only documents provided in this directory are ``lblinfo.txt''
   and ``onlabels.txt''. They describe the location and naming of the PDS
   labels in this data set (``lblinfo.txt'') and the keywords and
   values found in these labels (``onlabels.txt'').
