Extra Data Related to the MSL Mission
=====================================

   This directory contains value added elements that are outside the
   scope of the PDS archive requirements. Items included in this
   directory are currently limited to the meta-kernels.

   The meta-kernels provided in the ``mk'' subdirectory contain
   complete lists of the SPICE kernels, in the format required by the main
   SPICE data loader routine FURNSH, that need to be loaded into a
   SPICE-based application to compute geometry for a particular time
   period. For more information about the meta-kernels provided on this
   volume, see file ``mk/mkinfo.txt''.
