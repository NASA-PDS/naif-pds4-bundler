      Instrument Overview
      ===================
      SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information
      needed to recover the full value of science instrument data.
      In particular SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary
      ephemerides, instrument mounting alignments, spacecraft
      orientation and spacecraft sequences of events. Data needed
      for relevant time conversions are also included.

      There is no instrument directly associated with SPICE data.
      However, this template ensures that referential integrity is
      maintained in the PDS catalog."
