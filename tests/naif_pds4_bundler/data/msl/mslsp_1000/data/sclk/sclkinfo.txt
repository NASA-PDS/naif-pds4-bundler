General Information About SPICE SCL-Kernels
===========================================

   In the SPICE system, Spacecraft Clock (or SCL) -kernel contains a
   set of information required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
   time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). For surface missions
   like MSL SCLK kernel files are also used to provide data for
   conversions between ET and Local Mean Solar Time (LMST).

   The spacecraft clock coefficient information contained in the SCLK
   files can be manipulated using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to
   which can be integrated into user application programs. The
   information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system toolkit for a
   number of languages and computer platforms is located in the
   ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data set.

   Refer to the ``sclk.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about conversion between ET and spacecraft clock
   times.


MSL SCL-kernels Provided in This Data Set
=========================================

   This data set contains the following MSL SCLK files (only the
   leading portion of the file name is shown; the extension of all file
   names is ".tsc"):

      msl_76_sclkscet_[vvvvv]      operational MSL Spacecraft clock
                                   coefficients kernel (SCLK) files
                                   providing correlation data for the
                                   primary MSL on-board clock tags,
                                   where [vvvvv] is the file version
                                   (example: ``00005'' for Version 5).
                                   These SCLK files contain the MSL
                                   on-board clock to ET correlation
                                   used during operations.

      msl_76_sclkscet_refit_[V]    improved MSL Spacecraft clock
                                   coefficients kernel (SCLK) files
                                   providing correlation data for the
                                   primary MSL on-board clock tags,
                                   where [V] is a 1-3 letter version
                                   designator (e.g. "h2"). These SCLK
                                   files contain improved MSL on-board
                                   clock to ET mapping correlation
                                   determined for inclusion into the
                                   archive.

     msl_lmst_ops120808_v1         SCLK kernel implementing MSL LMST.


   If multiple versions of an SCLK file are provided, always use the
   latest version unless an earlier version is needed for consistency
   purposes.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in an SCLK file is provided
   in metadata included inside the descriptive text areas within the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor.
