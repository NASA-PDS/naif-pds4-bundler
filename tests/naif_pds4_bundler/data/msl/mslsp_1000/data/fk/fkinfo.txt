General Information About SPICE FRAMES Kernels
==============================================

   In the SPICE system, FRAMES kernel contains a set of information
   required to define various frames used in a particular mission,
   sources of orientation and origin location information for these
   frames and inter-connections between these frames and other frames
   supported within the SPICE system.

   The frame definitions information contained in the file can be
   utilized in conjunction with other data using the SPICE Toolkit
   APIs, calls to which can be integrated into user application
   programs. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system
   toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is located
   in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data
   set.

   Refer to the ``frames.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about definition and usage of the frames within the
   SPICE system.


MSL FRAMES Kernels Provided in This Data Set
============================================

   The following Frames Kernel files are included in this data set (only
   the name portion of the file name is shown on the right; the
   extension of all file names is ".tf"):

      msl_v[VER]           MSL Frames kernel file containing
                           definitions for the MSL rover, instruments,
                           and structures.

   If this data set contains multiple FK files, the one with the latest
   version ([VER]) supersedes all previous versions.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in an FK file is provided in
   metadata included inside the descriptive text area of the file. This
   information can be viewed using any text editor.
