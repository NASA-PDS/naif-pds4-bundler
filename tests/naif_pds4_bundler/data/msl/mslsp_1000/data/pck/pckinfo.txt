General Information About SPICE PC-kernels
==========================================

   In the SPICE system, the PC-kernels contain planetary attitude and
   body shape information. The PCK kernel includes orientation and
   shape information pertaining to extended solar system bodies such as
   the Sun, the planets, the natural satellites of the planets, comets,
   and asteroids.

   The purpose of the PCK kernels and associated software is to provide
   SPICE users with a convenient mechanism for supplying planetary
   physical constants to application programs. SPICE's PCK software is
   able to read files conforming to the PCK format and return to a
   calling application program both the data contained in such files
   and a small number of commonly used numeric quantities derived from
   the kernel data. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE
   system toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is
   located in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of
   this data set.

   Refer to the ``pck.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information on how to access PC-kernel data.


MSL PC-kernel Provided in This Data Set
========================================

   The following PC-kernel files are included in this data set (only
   the name portion of the file name is shown on the right; the
   extension of all file names is ".tpc".

       pck00008             generic PCK file containing information for
                            the Sun, all Solar planets and satellites,
                            and selected comets and asteroids, based on
                            the constants from the IAU 2000 report.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in a text PCK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the descriptive text areas
   within the file. This information can be viewed using any text
   editor.
