General Information About SPICE C-Kernels
=========================================

   In the SPICE system, pointing data for an instrument platform, or
   for a specific instrument, are stored C-kernels. The pointing of a
   platform or an instrument is often expressed in terms of a
   transformation matrix from some standard inertial reference frame to
   a instrument-fixed frame. In the past, the instrument was often a
   camera, and the transformation was thus dubbed the ``C-matrix'';
   hence the choice of C as the name for the pointing kernel.

   The data contained in C-kernel files can be accessed and manipulated
   using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to which can be integrated into
   user application programs. The information regarding how to obtain
   the SPICE system toolkit for a number of languages and computer
   platforms is located in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main
   directory of this data set.

   To use C-kernels, a Spacecraft Clock Kernel (SCLK) is required.
   Also, for C-Kernels containing orientation of a project-defined
   frames, a Frame Definitions File is required.

   Refer to the ``ck.req'' document provided with the toolkit or
   available from the NAIF Node of PDS if SPICE toolkit is not included
   with this data set to get more information on how to access C-kernel
   data.

                                        This is an auxiliary CK needed
                                        to complete the frame chain from
                                        the rover to the instruments
                                        mounted on RA.

   For all CK files whose names include version (V) the files with the
   latest version number supersede all files of the same kind with
   earlier versions.

   For all CK files whose names include SOL coverage boundaries (BBBB
   and EEEE) and version (V) the files with the later coverage range
   and the latest version number supersede competing data from files
   with earlier coverage and versions.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in a binary CK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the comment area of the file.
   This information can be viewed using utility programs COMMNT and
   SPACIT included into the NAIF Toolkit.


Gaps in CK Coverage
===================

   Both cruise CKs and surface rover and articulating structures CKs
   have gaps in coverage. While in the cruise CKs cannot be ``closed'',
   surface CKs can be modified using the CKSPANIT utility program to
   provide continuous coverage obtained by linear interpolation over
   gaps, resulting in orientation during gaps that is less accurate but
   still possibly acceptable for some applications (e.g.
   visualization). To modify a rover or an articulating structure
   orientation CK to ``close'' coverage gaps, CKSPANIT can be run as
   follows:

      % ckspanit -in [input_ck] -out [output_ck] -tol 2E+12 -frm [fk]
