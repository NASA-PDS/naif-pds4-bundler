General Information About SPICE SP-Kernels
==========================================

   The purpose of the SP-kernel -- which stands for S(pacecraft) and
   P(lanet) Kernel -- is to allow ephemerides for any collection of
   solar system bodies, spacecraft or any other objects in 3D space to
   be combined under a common file format, and accessed by a common set
   of subroutines.

   The SPK files can be accessed and manipulated using the SPICE
   Toolkit APIs, calls to which can be integrated into user application
   programs. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system
   toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is located
   in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data
   set.

   To use SP-kernels, a Leapseconds (LSK) is required. Also, to use
   SP-Kernels containing positions given relative to the non-inertial
   and project-defined frames, a Frame Definitions (FK) and Planetary
   Constants (PCK) files are required.

   Refer to the ``spk.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information on how to access SP-kernel data.


MSL SP-kernels Provided in This Data Set
=========================================

   The following MSL SP-kernels are provided in this data set (only
   the name portion of the file name is shown; the extension of all
   file names is ``.bsp''):

                                       determined by the MSL EDL Team,
                                       JPL. The file with the latest

                                       body-fixed frame (IAU_MARS,
                                       based on IAU 2000 Mars rotation
                                       constants), determined by the

                                       site. This file was used during
                                       operations by CHRONOS and other
                                       applications that were not
                                       sensitive to the local rover
                                       movements.
