General Information About SPICE E-Kernels
=========================================

   The purpose of the Events (E) -kernel is to store different kinds of
   the spacecraft and science instrument events related information
   such as spacecraft and instrument commands, status parameters,
   records of spacecraft activities, ground events, and so on, and to
   systematize and provide access to this data in relational data base
   -like fashion.

   The means of an access to the EK data are provided via SPICE Toolkit
   APIs, calls to which can be integrated into user application
   programs. The information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system
   toolkit for a number of languages and computer platforms is located
   in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data
   set.

   To use E-kernels with INSPEKT program, a Leapseconds (LSK) is
   required.

   Refer to the ``ek.req'' and ``inspekt.ug'' documents provided with the
   toolkit to get more information on how to access E-kernel data.


MSL E-kernels Provided in This Data Set
=======================================

   As the MSL project did not produce any EK files, no EKs are included
   in this data set.
