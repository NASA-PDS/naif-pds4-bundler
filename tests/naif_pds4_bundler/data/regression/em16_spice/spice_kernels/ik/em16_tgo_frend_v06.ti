Implementation Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Applications that need SPICE I-kernel data must ``load'' the I-kernel file,
   normally during program initialization. The SPICE routine FURNSH loads a
   kernel file into the pool as shown below.

      CALL FURNSH ( 'frame_kernel_name' )    -- FORTRAN
      furnsh_c ( "frame_kernel_name" );      -- C
      cspice_furnsh, frame_kernel_name       -- IDL
      cspice_furnsh( 'frame_kernel_name' )   -- MATLAB
      furnsh( frame_kernel_name )            -- PYTHON*

   Loading the kernel using the SPICELIB routine FURNSH causes the data
   items and their associated values present in the kernel to become
   associated with a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. 
   
   Once the file has been loaded, the SPICE routine GETFOV (getfov_c in
   C, cspice_getfov in IDL and MATLAB and cspice.getfov in PYTHON) can be 
   used to retrieve FOV parameters for a given instrument or structure.
   
   The application program may obtain the value(s) for any other IK data
   item using the SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, GCPOOL (gdpool_c, gipool_c,
   gcpool_c in C, cspice_gdpool, cspice_gipool, cspice_gcpool in IDL and
   MATLAB, cspice.gcpool in PYTHON). See [2] for details.

   This file was created with, and can be updated with a text editor or
   word processor.

Naming Conventions and Conventions for Specifying Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Data items are specified using ``keyword=value'' assignments [1].
   All keywords referencing values in this I-kernel start with the
   characters `INS' followed by the NAIF TGO instrument ID code,
   constructed using the spacecraft ID number (-143) followed by the
   NAIF three digit ID number for FREND module. These IDs are
   defined in [2] as follows:
   
      Name                         NAIF ID
     ---------------------        ---------
      TGO_FREND                    -143200


   The remainder of the keyword name is an underscore character
   followed by the unique name of the data item. For example, the
   FREND stilbene scintillator detector boresight direction in
   the TGO_FREND frame is specified by:

           INS-143200_BORESIGHT


   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.

   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same
   item appears more than once within a single file, the latest value
   supersedes any earlier values.


Instrument Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   FREND contains four 3He counters for neutrons with energies from 0.4 keV
   to 500 keV, and stilbene-based scintillator for high-energy neutrons
   (up to 10 MeV) (see [3]). All of them have a narrow field of view (FOV)
   with a pixel size corresponding to 40 km on the Martian surface.
   
   The instrument also includes a dosimetry module, which will constantly
   monitor the radiation environment while in orbit around the planet.
   
   The 3He detectors are proportional counters filled with helium-3 under
   a pressure of 6 atmospheres and placed inside four openings of the
   collimator. Each of them counts neutrons independently, such that the count
   statistics is higher (and, thus, maps are statistically more reliable)
   and the instrument is more resistant to failures.
   
   These detectors measure neutrons with energies ranging from 0.4 to 500 keV.
   The Scintillation counter, which uses stilbene crystal, measures fast 
   neutrons with energies between 0.5-10 MeV. The counter is placed inside the 
   collimator. Scintillation module includes an anti-coincidence shielding, to 
   discriminate between signals from high-energy charged particles and 
   neutrons.
   
   FREND's collimation module is a passive element, encasing all five
   detectors. The collimator consists of two layers, the outer one made
   of high-density polyethylene, the inner one of enriched boron powder
   (B10). Neutrons, hitting the collimator's sides, are slowed down by
   polyethylene, with a large number of hydrogen atoms. So thermalized
   neutrons then pass through and get into the B10 layer, which absorbs them.
   
   The collimator's opening angle narrows FOV of the detectors to the spot 
   with a diameter of 40 km on the Martian surface, when seen from the 
   circular orbit with 400 km altitude -which is the one allocated for TGO-.
   
   The Liulin-MO dosimetry module's detection system consists of two
   telescopes with 2 semiconductor detectors (effective area of 2 cm2)
   each. The Dosimeter's energy resolution is not lower than 100 keV in
   100keV - 8MeV energy release range (in the detector) and not lower
   than 350 keV in a 8 - 70 MeV range.

FOV Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The FREND Detectors Field of view is defined based on the shape of the 
   detectors aperture in the -Y instrument side, and the distance to detector 
   along this axis from the aperture, corresponding to a circular field of 
   view with a half cone of 7.5 degrees (see [4], NR26-1).
   
   The instrument and detectors boresight is along the -Y TGO_FREND axis 
   pointing --nominally-- towards the s/c nadir direction.
   
   This section contains an assignment defining the FREND FOV. This definition 
   is based on the FREND detector layout provided in the previous section and 
   are provided in a format consistent with/required by the SPICE TOOLKIT 
   function GETFOV.
