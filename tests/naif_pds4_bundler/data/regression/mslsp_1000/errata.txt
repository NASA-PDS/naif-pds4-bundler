COMMENTS ON THE MSL SPICE DATA ARCHIVE
======================================

   This document contains comments and errata concerning the MSL SPICE
   Data Archive.


1. Text Kernel File Format
--------------------------

   All SPICE text kernel files (LSK, PCK, SCLK, IK, FK) provided in
   this data set have lines terminated by only <LF> (UNIX convention.)
   This is dictated by NAIF's archiving approach to include a
   consistent set of UNIX binary (IEEE architecture) and text (<LF>
   only for end of line marker) kernels in the archived data sets.

   However, the format of the text kernels is specified in their
   associated labels as ASCII (INTERCHANGE_FORMAT = ASCII.) This is a
   violation of the PDS standard stating that lines in ASCII files must
   be delimited by the combination of <CR><LF>. This line termination
   treatment is standard practice for SPICE data sets in the PDS.


2. Use of SPACECRAFT_NAME in the Labels
---------------------------------------

   PDS labels for SPICE kernels provided in this data set contain the
   deprecated keyword SPACECRAFT_NAME instead of the keyword
   INSTRUMENT_HOST_NAME. This is standard practice for SPICE data sets in
   the PDS and is dictated by NAIF's archiving approach to make SPICE
   archives for more recent missions consistent with SPICE archives for
   older missions, for which use of SPACECRAFT_NAME was legitimate.


3. Values of INSTRUMENT_NAME in the Labels
------------------------------------------

   PDS labels for SPICE kernels provided in this data do not set the
   keyword INSTRUMENT_NAME to "SPICE KERNELS", that is the name of the
   instrument described by the instrument catalog file SPICE_INST.CAT
   provided in the data set. Instead this keyword is set to either
   "N/A" or the name(s) of the instrument(s) or structure(s), the
   geometric parameters of which a particular kernel file provides.
   While this error does prevent the individual data products from
   being associated with the "SPICE KERNELS" instrument, it does not
   affect usability of the SPICE data provided in this data set in any
   way because the SPICE Toolkit does not use any information from the
   PDS label to access the data.

   The other side of this error is that the data set does not include
   instrument catalog files for the following instruments named in
   the INSTRUMENT_NAME keyword in the PDS labels:

     "ALPHA PARTICLE X-RAY SPECTROMETER"
     "CHEMISTRY AND MINERALOGY"
     "CHEMISTRY CAMERA LASER INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROMETER"
     "CHEMISTRY CAMERA REMOTE MICRO-IMAGER"
     "COLLECTION AND HANDLING FOR IN-SITU MARTIAN ROCK ANALYSIS"
     "CRUISE MEDIUM GAIN ANTENNA"
     "CRUISE STAGE"
     "DESCENT STAGE LOW GAIN ANTENNA"
     "DESCENT STAGE UHF ANTENNA"
     "DUST REMOVAL TOOL"
     "DYNAMIC ALBEDO OF NEUTRONS"
     "HAZARD AVOIDANCE CAMERA"
     "HIGH GAIN ANTENNA"
     "MARS DESCENT IMAGER"
     "MARS HAND LENS IMAGER"
     "MAST CAMERA"
     "NAVIGATION CAMERA"
     "PARACHUTE CONE LOW GAIN ANTENNA"
     "PARACHUTE CONE UHF ANTENNA"
     "POWDER ACQUISITION DRILL SYSTEM"
     "RADIATION ASSESSMENT DETECTOR"
     "REMOTE SENSING MAST"
     "ROBOTIC ARM"
     "ROVER ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING STATION"
     "ROVER LOW GAIN ANTENNA"
     "ROVER UHF ANTENNA"
     "ROVER"
     "SAMPLE ANALYSIS AT MARS"
     "TILTED LOW GAIN ANTENNA"


4. Missing FILE_RECORDS Keyword in the Binary Kernel Labels
-----------------------------------------------------------

   All labels for binary SPICE kernels provided in this data set are
   missing the FILE_RECORDS keyword, which is required because these
   labels have the RECORD_TYPE keyword set to FIXED_LENGTH. While this
   error violates the PDS standards, it does not affect usability of
   the SPICE data provided in this data set in any way because the
   SPICE toolkit does not use any information from the PDS labels to
   access the data.


5. START_TIME and STOP_TIME in Rover Path SPK Labels
----------------------------------------------------

   The START_TIME and STOP_TIME keywords in the rover path SPK files
   normally covering a range of SOLs are not set to the bounds of the
   rover location coverage but to the much wider coverage for the site
   locations along the rover path, e.g.

      START_TIME                   = 2000-12-31T23:58:56
      STOP_TIME                    = 2099-12-31T23:58:53

   The coverage SOL range is specified in the file name, the label
   DESCRIPTION keyword and in the file comments.


6. Data Not Provided in Release 0001
------------------------------------

   The following kernels were not available at the release 0001 time:

      -  reconstructed cruise attitude CK modeling spin during the
         whole cruise, by the MSL ACS Team

      -  reconstructed cruise attitude CK by the MSL NAV Team

      -  separate IKs for non-camera instruments

   They will be added to the archive in one the future releases.


7. Incorrect SOL Range in DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------

   The DESCRIPTION field in the labels of kernels covering the SOL
   range 1772 to 1869 (data/*/*1772_1869*.lbl) incorrectly states that
   the range is SOLs 1648 to 1772.


End of errata.
