Meta-kernels for the MSL Mission
================================

   This directory contains the meta-kernel files (a.k.a ``furnsh''
   files) that provide lists of the archived kernels included in this
   data set suitable for loading into a SPICE-based application via the
   high level SPICE data loader routine FURNSH. Using these
   meta-kernels makes it easy to load with one call a comprehensive
   SPICE data collection for a given period. Like the text kernels
   archived in this data set, these meta-kernels are UNIX text files
   that have lines terminated with a line feed character, LF (ASCII 10).

   The names of the meta-kernels provided in this directory follow these
   patterns:

      msl_vVV.tm

   and

      msl_chronos_vVV.tm

   where ``VV'' is the file version. The meta-kernels with
   ``msl_vVV.tm'' names provide the complete sets of best available
   kernels while the meta-kernels with ``msl_chronos_vVV.tm'' names
   provide only kernels needed for the CHRONOS time-conversion program.

   Multiple versions of a meta-kernel may exist if new kernels were
   added to the archive in a later release and the meta-kernel had to
   be updated to incorporate them. The reasons for adding new kernels
   include (but are not limited to) adding new kinds of kernels, adding
   new versions of existing kernels containing more complete or more
   accurate data, and adding new versions of existing kernels
   superseding the existing kernels that had errors. If more than one
   meta-kernel file is present, then the file with the latest version
   number supersedes all earlier versions.

   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the root directory of the data set -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to './data' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the data set's 'data' directory on their
   system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in all
   path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.

   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these complete meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCK, on-board clock and
         LMST SCLKs, IKs, FK, planetary ephemeris SPK, satellite
         ephemeris SPK, cruise SPK, EDL SPK and CK, landing site SPK,
         localized rover surface path SPK, and rover, RSM, RA, and HGA
         CKs were included

      -  only the reconstructed cruise CK based on real-time telemetry
         during communication periods was included.

   The meta-kernels intended for use by CHRONOS provide the same sets
   of kernels as they provided during OPS except for the cruise and EDL
   SPKs.
