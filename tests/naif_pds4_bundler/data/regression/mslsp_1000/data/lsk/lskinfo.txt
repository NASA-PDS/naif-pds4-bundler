General Information About SPICE LS-kernels
==========================================

   In the SPICE system, Leapsecond (or LS) -kernel contains the
   leapseconds and the values of physical constants required to perform
   a transformation between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and
   Ephemeris time (ET).

   The information in an LSK file can be manipulated in conjunction
   with other data using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to which can be
   integrated into user application programs. The information regarding
   how to obtain the SPICE system toolkit for a number of languages and
   computer platforms is located in the ``/software'' subdirectory of the
   main directory of this data set.

   Refer to the ``time.req'' document provided with the toolkit to get
   more information about time conversions supported within the SPICE
   system.


MSL LS-kernel Provided in This Data Set
=======================================

   The generic LSK file naming schema is as follows:

        naifVVVV.tls

   where

        VVVV       is the version of the file (example: "0007" is
                      version 7);

   If this data set contains multiple LSK files, the one with the latest
   version ([VVVV]) supersedes all previous versions.


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in an LSK file is provided
   in metadata included inside the descriptive text areas within the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor.
