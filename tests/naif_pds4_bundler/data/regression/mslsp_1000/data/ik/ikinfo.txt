General Information About SPICE I-kernels
=========================================

   In the SPICE system, I-kernels contain field-of-view specifications,
   internal timing parameters, detector geometry specifications and
   other geometric parameters for the instrument. These parameters
   along with knowledge of the spacecraft pointing (C kernel) and
   instrument mounting alignment (Frames Kernel) allow the user to use
   SPICE APIs to calculate the view directions of the individual
   instrument pixels or detectors.

   The data contained in I-kernel files can be accessed and manipulated
   in conjunction with other data using the SPICE Toolkit APIs, calls to
   which can be integrated into user application programs. The
   information regarding how to obtain the SPICE system toolkit for a
   number of languages and computer platforms is located in the
   ``/software'' subdirectory of the main directory of this data set.

   Refer to the ``kernel.req'' document provided with the Toolkit to get
   more information on how to access I-kernel data.


MSL I-kernels Provided in This Data Set
=======================================

   All files are in IEEE text format and must be copied using ftp ASCII
   transfer to any non-UNIX workstation.

   The MSL IK file naming schema is as follows (Only the leading
   portions of the file names are shown; the file name extensions of
   the I-kernel are always ".ti"):

         msl_[IIIII]_v[VER]

      or

         msl_[IIIII]_[YYYYMMDD]_c[CC]

      where:

         [IIIII]     Instrument or subsystem acronym:

         [CC]        Camera calibration ID (for IKs derived from
                     CAHVORE models).

   If multiple versions of an IK file are provided for an instrument,
   always use the file with the latest version or the latest creation
   date/camera calibration ID (unless an earlier file is needed for
   some special reason.)


Kernel File Details
===================

   The most detailed description of the data in an IK file is provided
   in metadata included inside the descriptive text areas within the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor.
