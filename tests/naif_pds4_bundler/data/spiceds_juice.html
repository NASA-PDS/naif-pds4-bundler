Overview
========

   This archive includes the complete set of JUICE SPICE data files
   (kernel files), which can be accessed using SPICE software. The
   SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information needed
   to recover the full value of science instrument data. In particular
   SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary ephemerides,
   spacecraft and instrument orientation, instrument mounting
   alignments, and data needed for relevant time conversions. Data in
   the SPICE kernel files must be accessed using the software called
   the SPICE Toolkit produced and distributed by the Navigation and
   Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data
   System.

   This archive includes data covering from JUICE launch,
   through the end time of the latest spacecraft orientation file
   supplied in the archive. Until the end of the spacecraft lifespan
   this archive will be accumulating with new data added according to
   the project archiving plan.

Errata
======

   1. This document is a simple HTML document. Providing documents in a
      simple mark-up format was allowed by earlier versions of the PDS4
      Standards but became prohibited in later versions starting summer
      2015. Since the document was compliant at the time when the first
      SPICE Bundle was released and for the sake of cross agency
      consistency of SPICE bundles, it will exist in the archive
      as an HTML document.

   2. C-Matrix Kernels generated from housekeeping telemetry contain several
      gaps for different known reasons. Some of the gaps might be restored in
      future versions of the bundle. Note that for S/C attitude those gaps
      are covered by predicted CK files.

Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of
   this archive.

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this
   archive.

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   DSK (Digital Shape Kernel) files contain detailed shape models for
   extended objects. These objects typically are solar system bodies such as
   planets, dwarf planets, natural satellites, asteroids, and comet nuclei.
   DSK data also can represent shapes of artificial objects such as spacecraft
   components or represent abstractions such as a magnetic field model.
   DSK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/dsk/">spice_kernels/dsk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory of this archive.

MK Files

   Meta-kernel (MK) files (a.k.a 'furnsh' files) provide lists of the
   archived kernels included in this archive suitable for loading into
   a SPICE-based application via the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. Using meta-kernels makes it easy to load with
   one call a comprehensive SPICE data collection for a given period.

   The text MK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  JUICE MK files

               juice_vVVV.tm

            where

               VVV       is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

   The reasons for adding new kernels include (but are not limited to)
   adding new kinds of kernels, adding new versions of existing kernels
   containing more complete or more accurate data, and adding new
   versions of existing kernels superseding the existing kernels that
   had errors. The file with the latest version number supersedes all
   earlier versions.

   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the directory in which they reside -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to '..' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the archive's 'spice_kernels' directory on
   their system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in
   all path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.

   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCK, SCLK, IK, FK, generic
         SPKs, fixed offset SPKs, and fixed orientation CKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed SPKs were included

      -  the latest predicted and reconstructed CKs were included

   Additional description of the kernels sets listed in a text MK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

Miscellaneous Files
===================

   Miscellaneous files provide value added elements that are outside the
   scope of the PDS archive requirements. Miscellaneous files included in
   this archive are currently limited to checksum files.

   The subsection below provides details for these files.

<a href="#Table of Contents" style="float: right;">Back to Table of Contents</a>
<a name="Checksum Files"></a>
Checksum Files

   A checksum file provides a table of MD5 checksums for all files in the
   archive as of a particular archive (bundle) version, including
   checksums for all previous checksums files and their labels but
   excluding the checksum for the checksum file itself and its label.

   The checksum files are provided under the <a href="../miscellaneous/checksum/">miscellaneous/checksum</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  JUICE checksum files

               checksum_vVVV.tab

            where

               VVV       is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions and can be
                         used to validate the archive in its
                         entirety.

<a name="File Formats"></a>
File Formats
============

   All text documents, checksum files, and other meta information files
   such as descriptions, detached PDS4 labels, and inventory tables are
   stream format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed
   character (ASCII 10) at the end of the records. This allows the
   files to be read by most operating systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, FKs,
   and MKs -- are UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10) at
   the end of the line, and binary kernels files -- SPKs, CKs and DSKs --
   are IEEE LSB binary files. While data files in this archive can be used
   'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the majority of supported
   environments, converting the files to the binary or text format
   native to the user's computer may be required for use of the data
   with FORTRAN toolkits on incompatible environments. Refer to the
   documentation provided with the SPICE Toolkit to find out whether
   conversion is needed in each specific case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
