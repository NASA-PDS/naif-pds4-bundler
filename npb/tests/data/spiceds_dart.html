<A NAME="Overview"></A>
Overview
========
 
   This archive includes the complete set of DART SPICE data files
   (kernel files), which can be accessed using SPICE software. The
   SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information needed
   to recover the full value of science instrument data. In particular
   SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary ephemerides, spacecraft 
   and instrument orientation, instrument mounting alignments, and data 
   needed for relevant time conversions. Data in the SPICE kernel files 
   must be accessed using the software called the SPICE Toolkit produced
   and distributed by the Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility
   (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data System.

   This archive includes data covering from DART launch, 2021-11-18,
   through the end time of the latest spacecraft orientation file
   supplied in the archive. Until the end of the spacecraft lifespan
   this archive will be accumulating with new data added according to
   the project archiving plan.

Errata
======

   1. This document is a simple HTML document. Providing documents in a
      simple mark-up format was allowed by earlier versions of the PDS4
      Standards but became prohibited in later versions starting summer
      2015. Since using HTML documents was compliant at the time when a
      similar document was first provided in the MAVEN PDS4 archive and
      since NAIF strives to make bundle description document format and
      style consistent across all archives, this document continues
      to exist in this archive as an HTML document.

<A NAME="Kernel Types"></A>
Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK 
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of 
   this archive.
 
   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this 
   archive.
 
   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a> 
   directory of this archive.

   DSK (Digital Shape Kernel) files contain detailed shape models for
   extended objects such as planets, natural satellites, asteroids, and 
   comet nuclei. DSK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a> 
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a> 
   directory of this archive.

<A NAME="SCLK Files"></A>
SCLK Files

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
   time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK).
 
   This archive includes text SCLK files containing correlation data
   for the main DART on-board clock, created by NAIF from the
   SCLK_SCET files generated by the Spacecraft Team, LMCO.
 
   The SCLK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  spacecraft clock SCLK files

               NAME_sclk_VVVVV.tsc

            where 
    
               NAME      is either "dart" or "licia".

               VVVVV     is the version; the file with the latest 
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

<A NAME="FK Files"></A>
FK Files

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments.
 
   This archive includes text FK files defining reference frames for
   the DART spacecraft, its structures, and science instruments.
   These FKs were produced by NAIF using the spacecraft and instrument
   design documentation as well as actual instrument alignment values
   determined pre-launch and as the result of in-flight calibrations.

   The FK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  Spacecraft FK files

               NAME_VVV.tf

            where 

               NAME      is the name of the spacecraft in lower case; either 
                         "dart" or "licia"".

               VVV       is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named files
                         with earlier versions, although a SPICE user
                         might decide decide to use an earlier version
                         if trying to be consistent with some earlier
                         computed results.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text FK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="DSK Files"></A>
DSK Files

   DSK (Digital Shape Kernel) files contain detailed shape models for
   extended objects such as planets, natural satellites, asteroids, and
   comet nuclei.

   This archive includes binary DSK files containing digital shape data
   for the DART mission target asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos. These DSKs 
   were produced by the DART Altimetry Working Group.

   The DSK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/dsk/">spice_kernels/dsk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

<A NAME="File Formats"></A>
File Formats
============

   All text documents and other meta information files such as
   descriptions, detached PDS4 labels, inventory tables, and checksum
   files are stream format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and 
   a line feed character (ASCII 10) at the end of the records. This 
   allows the files to be read by most operating systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, FKs, 
   and MKs -- are UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10) 
   at the end of the line, and binary kernels files -- SPKs and CKs --
   are IEEE LSB binary files. While data files in this archive can be 
   used 'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the majority of supported
   environments, converting the files to the binary or text format
   native to the user's computer may be required for use of the data
   with FORTRAN toolkits on incompatible environments. Refer to the
   documentation provided with the SPICE Toolkit to find out whether
   conversion is needed in each specific case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
