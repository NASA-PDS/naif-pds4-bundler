<A NAME="Overview"></A>
Overview
========
 
   This archive includes the complete set of MAVEN SPICE data files
   (kernel files), which can be accessed using SPICE software. The
   SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information needed
   to recover the full value of science instrument data. In particular
   SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary ephemerides,
   spacecraft and instrument orientation, instrument mounting
   alignments, and data needed for relevant time conversions. Data in
   the SPICE kernel files must be accessed using the software called
   the SPICE Toolkit produced and distributed by the Navigation and
   Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data
   System.

   This archive includes data covering from MAVEN launch, 2013-11-18,
   through the end time of the latest spacecraft orientation file
   supplied in the archive. Until the end of the spacecraft lifespan
   this archive will be accumulating with new data added according to
   the project archiving plan.

<A NAME="Errata"></A>
Errata
======

   1. No IK file for the STATIC instrument was available at the time of
      the initial archive release. It was added to the archive in the
      release 2 (August 2015).

   2. All XML labels in the releases 1 (May 2015) and 2 (August 2015)
      referred to the PDS4 information model version 1.4.0.0 while
      setting the Primary_Result_Summary purpose attribute to the
      "Observation Geometry" value, which was added to the model only
      in version 1.5.0.0. This made these labels non-compliant. During
      preparation of the release 3 (November 2015) the information
      model version and references to the model schema and schematron
      files in the offending labels were changed from 1.4.0.0 to
      1.5.0.0 to make them compliant.

   3. This document is a simple HTML document. Providing documents in a 
      simple mark-up format was allowed by earlier versions of the PDS4
      Standards but became prohibited in later versions starting summer
      2015. Since the document was compliant at the time when its first
      version was released, it will continue to exist in the archive
      as an HTML document.

   4. Some of the daily IUVS CK files used as input in generating the 
      "v01" merged IUVS CKs covering years 2014-2016 were incomplete,
      missing 10-20% of data. When this was discovered in May 2017,
      all merged IUVS CKs for these years were regenerated using the
      complete daily CKs, and were added to the archive as "v02" files,
      fully superseding "v01" files.

   5. Some of the reconstructed CK spacecraft and post-deploy Articulating
      Payload Platform (APP) files present data gaps. When these gaps are
      significant (when they have a duration of several hours), these data
      gaps are covered by the corresponding predicted CK files. In the
      current release these gaps are present on 2021-01-14 and 2021-01-15.

<A NAME="Kernel Types"></A>
Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.
 
   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK 
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of 
   this archive.
 
   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this 
   archive.
 
   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a> 
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a> 
   directory of this archive.

   size and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and
   prime meridian.

   This archive includes generic text PCK files produced by NAIF,
   containing data from the reports of the IAU Working Group on
   Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements. The generic text
   PCK version 00010 contains data from the 2009 report.

   The PCK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  generic text PCKs

               pckVVVVV.tpc

            where 

               VVVVV     is the version; the file with the largest
                         number is the latest, but the user of PCK
                         data must decide if the latest version, 
                         or an earlier version, is appropriate
                         for his/her analysis task.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text PCK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the

<A NAME="LSK Files"></A>
LSK Files

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB).

   This archive includes generic text LSK files produced by NAIF,
   containing leapsecond information based on the IERS announcements.
   The generic text LSK version 0011 contains leap second data up to
   and including the July 1, 2015 leapsecond.

   The LSK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  generic text LSKs

               naifVVVV.tls

            where 

               VVVV      is the version; the file with the latest 
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

   The most detailed description of the data in a text LSK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="SCLK Files"></A>
SCLK Files

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
   time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK).

   This archive includes text SCLK files containing correlation data
   for the main MAVEN on-board clock, created by NAIF from the
   SCLK_SCET files generated by the Spacecraft Team, LMCO.
 
   The SCLK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  main MAVEN spacecraft clock SCLK files

               mvn_sclkscet_VVVVV.tsc

            where 

               VVVVV     is the version; the file with the latest 
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.


   The most detailed description of the data in a text SCLK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="FK Files"></A>
FK Files

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. 

   This archive includes text FK files defining reference frames for the
   MAVEN spacecraft, its structures, and science instruments. These
   FKs were produced by NAIF using the spacecraft and instrument design
   documentation as well as actual instrument alignment values
   determined pre-launch and as the result of in-flight calibrations.

   The FK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  MAVEN mission FK files

               maven_vVV.tf

            where 

               VV        is the version; the file with the latest 
                         version supersedes all similarly named files
                         with earlier versions, although a SPICE user
                         might decide decide to use an earlier version
                         if trying to be consistent with some earlier
                         computed results.


   The most detailed description of the data in a text FK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="MK Files"></A>
MK Files

   Meta-kernel (MK) files (a.k.a 'furnsh' files) provide lists of the
   archived kernels included in this archive suitable for loading into
   a SPICE-based application via the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. Using meta-kernels makes it easy to load with
   one call a comprehensive SPICE data collection for a given period.

   The text MK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  MAVEN yearly MK files

               maven_YYYY_vVV.tm

            when 

               YYYY      is the year covered by the kernels listed in
                         the MK

               VV        is the version; the file with the latest 
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

   Multiple versions of a meta-kernel for the same year may exist if
   new kernels were added to the archive in a later release and the
   meta-kernel for that year had to be updated to incorporate them. The
   reasons for adding new kernels include (but are not limited to)
   adding new kinds of kernels, adding new versions of existing kernels
   containing more complete or more accurate data, and adding new
   versions of existing kernels superseding the existing kernels that
   had errors. If more than one meta-kernel file for the same year is
   present, then the file with the latest version number supersedes all
   earlier versions. The latest yearly meta-kernels can be loaded
   together sorted by year to provide coverage for more than one year.
   (Note that on some environments loading too many kernels at once may
   slow down data access.)
 
   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the directory in which they reside -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to '..' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the archive's 'spice_kernels' directory on
   their system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in
   all path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.
   
   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCK, SCLK, IK, FK, generic
         SPKs, fixed offset SPKs, and fixed orientation CKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed MAVEN NAV SPKs were included

      -  the adequate latest predicted CKs were included

      -  the latest reconstructed CKs were included

   Additional description of the kernels sets listed in a text MK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="File Formats"></A>
File Formats
============

   All text documents and other meta information files such as
   descriptions, detached PDS4 labels, and inventory tables are stream
   format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed
   character (ASCII 10) at the end of the records.  This allows the
   files to be read by most operating systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, and
   FKs -- are UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10) at
   the end of the line, and binary kernels files -- SPKs and CKs -- are
   IEEE LSB binary files. While data files in this archive can be used
   'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the majority of supported
   environments, converting the files to the binary or text format
   native to the user's computer may be required for use of the data
   with FORTRAN toolkits on incompatible environments. Refer to the
   documentation provided with the SPICE Toolkit to find out whether
   conversion is needed in each specific case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
