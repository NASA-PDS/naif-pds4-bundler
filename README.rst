================

The PDS4 Bundle Generator (naif-pds4-bundle) is a a pipeline that
generates a SPICE archive in the shape of a PDS4 Bundle or a PDS3
data set.

The pipeline is constructed by the orchestration of a family of
classes that can also be used independently.

In order to facilitate its usage the pipeline can be run in an
interactive mode that will allow the operator to check the
validity and/or correctness of each step of the process.
