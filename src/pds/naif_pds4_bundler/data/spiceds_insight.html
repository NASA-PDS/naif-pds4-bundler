<A NAME="Overview"></A>
Overview
========

   This archive includes the complete set of INSIGHT, MARCO-A, and
   MARCO-B SPICE data files (kernel files), which can be accessed using
   SPICE software. The SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary
   information needed to recover the full value of science instrument
   data. In particular SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary
   ephemerides, spacecraft and instrument orientation, instrument
   mounting alignments, and data needed for relevant time conversions.
   Data in the SPICE kernel files must be accessed using the software
   called the SPICE Toolkit produced and distributed by the Navigation
   and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data
   System.

   This archive includes data covering from INSIGHT launch, 2018-05-05,
   through the end time of the latest Instrument Deployment Arm (IDA)
   orientation file supplied in the archive. Until the end of the
   spacecraft lifespan this archive will be accumulating with new data
   added according to the project archiving plan.

<A NAME="Errata"></A>
Errata
======

   1. This document is a simple HTML document. Providing documents in a
      simple mark-up format was allowed by earlier versions of the PDS4
      Standards but became prohibited in later versions starting summer
      2015. Since using HTML documents was compliant at the time when a
      similar document was first provided in the MAVEN PDS4 archive and
      since NAIF strives to make bundle description document format and
      style consistent across all archives, this document continues
      to exist in this archive as an HTML document.

   2. All MARCO-A and MARCO-B kernels included in the archive
      are labeled as being associate the INSIGHT instrument host.

   3. No SCLK kernels the instrument clocks (LOBT and AOBT) are
      provided or planned to be provided for.

   4. No deflected IDC SPKs and CKs are yet included in the archive.
      Some may be included in subsequent releases.

   5. The IDC and ICC frames definitions provided in the INSIGHT mission
      FK and their parameters provided in the corresponding IKs have
      not been full validated and, if used to compute derived geometry
      for these instruments, may produce results differing from the
      same kinds of geometric parameters provided in the image labels.

   6. The XML labels of the ancillary products have the reference_type
      attribute of the Internal_Reference association within the
      Reference_List class of the Context_Area class pointing to the latest
      archive description document set to "ancillary_to_data" which is not
      correct. The correct value "ancillary_to_document" could not be used
      in these labels because it is not available in the PDS4 information
      model (IM) 1.5.0.0 used by this archive. This value was added to IM
      only in the version 1.14.0.0.

   7. The Miscellaneous collection was only added to the bundle in the
      release 10 (September 2021) and therefore the checksum tables and
      collection inventories and their labels that correspond to previous
      releases were added irregularly in that release. This is reflected
      in the bundle label of that particular release that contains
      additional Bundle_Member_Entry classes for these miscellaneous
      collections.

<A NAME="Kernel Types"></A>
Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of
   this archive.

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this
   archive.

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory of this archive.

<A NAME="FK Files"></A>
FK Files

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided

   This archive includes text FK files defining reference frames for
   the INSIGHT lander, its structures, and science instruments, and for
   MARCO-A and MARCO-B spacecraft and their structures and instruments.
   The MARCO-A and MARCO-B FK files also include definitions of structure
   and instrument FOVs. These FKs were produced by NAIF using the
   spacecraft and instrument design documentation as well as actual
   instrument alignment values determined pre-launch and as the result
   of in-flight calibrations.

   The FK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  INSIGHT mission FK files

               insight_vVV.tf

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="MK Files"></A>
MK Files

   Meta-kernel (MK) files (a.k.a 'furnsh' files) provide lists of the
   archived kernels included in this archive suitable for loading into
   a SPICE-based application via the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. Using meta-kernels makes it easy to load with
   one call a comprehensive SPICE data collection for a given period.

   The text MK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  INSIGHT whole mission MK files

               insight_vVV.tm

            when

               VV        is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions.

   In addition, all meta-kernels also include keywords setting the
   SPICE CHRONOS utility configuration parameters (spacecraft ID,
   planet ID, landing UTC, landing SOL index, and Sun GM).

   Although the meta-kernels were created such that on a UNIX
   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the directory in which they reside -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to '..' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the archive's 'spice_kernels' directory on
   their system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in
   all path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.

   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCK, and each kind of
         SCLKs, IKs, FKs, SPKs, and CKs (except for IDA and IDC CKs)
         were included

      -  for IDA and IDC CKs, only latest encoder-based CKs were
         included

   Additional description of the kernels sets listed in a text MK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

<A NAME="Miscellaneous Files"></A>
Miscellaneous Files
===================

   Miscellaneous files provide value added elements that are outside the
   scope of the PDS archive requirements. Miscellaneous files included in
   this archive are currently limited to checksum files.

   The subsection below provides details for these files.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="Checksum Files"></A>
Checksum Files

   A checksum file provides a table of MD5 checksums for all files in the
   archive as of a particular archive (bundle) version, including
   checksums for all previous checksums files and their labels but
   excluding the checksum for the checksum file itself and its label.

   The checksum files are provided under the <a href="../miscellaneous/checksum/">miscellaneous/checksum</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  INSIGHT checksum files

               checksum_vVVV.tab

            where

               VVV       is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions and can be
                         used to validate the archive in its
                         entirety.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="File Formats"></A>
File Formats
============

   All text documents, checksum files, and other meta information files
   such as descriptions, detached PDS4 labels, and inventory tables, are
   stream format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed
   character (ASCII 10) at the end of the records. This allows the files
   to be read by most operating systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, FKs,
   and MKs -- are UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10)
   at the end of each line. Binary kernel files -- SPKs and CKs -- are
   IEEE LSB binary files. While data files in this archive can be used
   'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the majority of supported environments,
   converting the files to the binary or text format native to the user's
   computer may be required for use of the data with FORTRAN toolkits on
   incompatible environments. Refer to the documentation provided with the
   SPICE Toolkit to find out whether conversion is needed in each specific
   case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
